<h1>Onsite Prep</h1>
<p>Growth initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow userbase to males?</li>
<li>Grow other demographics?</li>
<li>Look deep into product experimentation beyond just A/B designs</li>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-for-selecting-an-appropriate-metric-for-your-a-b-test-9068cccb7fb">selecting A/B testing metrics</a>: Point is that late funnel metrics might require a larger sample size because of the smaller effect size</li>
</ul>
<p>From <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/958601754/files/doc_financials/2019/q2/93a68ae2-b0f2-47d5-a14e-757e66a6f421.pdf">Risks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important metrics: growth, retention, frequency and duration of engagement or use.</li>
<li>Ad spend to acquire new users and retain current users</li>
<li>Audience approximately 43% of US internet users, 80% of women age 18-64 with children <a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/What-Potential-Does-Pinterest-Have-as-an-Advertising-Platform">user demographic</a></li>
<li>Maybe saturated with that demographic and need to grow to other demographics like men and international users</li>
<li>Pinterest requires good data, targeting areas with high smartphone penetration. Has partnerships with some data providers so that Pinterest doesn’t count toward user’s data quotas.</li>
<li>Not anticipating that majority of users will become DAUs</li>
<li>Risks:</li>
<li>competitors mimic product, users use competitiors more</li>
<li>User expreience degrades because of poor company decisions</li>
<li>failure to deliver relevant content</li>
<li>third parties pull content</li>
<li>software issues</li>
<li>bandwidth issues, slow and frustrating experience</li>
<li>privacy and security concerns</li>
<li>spam, harassment, cyberbullying, …</li>
<li>taking actions to maintain engaging and relevant content which lead to lower ad revenue</li>
<li>continuously monitor ads, too many ads or irrelevant ads could hurt user growth, retention, or engagement</li>
<li>future data privacy laws</li>
<li>new products or product enhancements could be ill received by pinners</li>
<li>Behavior required by a new product may not be easily learnable, which could hurt engagement, retention, and growth</li>
<li>Pinterest brand could be harmed. Currently Pinterest is an empowering environment, which helps engagement,retention,growth.</li>
<li>Poor perception of the advertisers chould also hurt Pinterest if it reduces eng,ret,gro</li>
<li>Scrutiny of “screen time”, privacy, or any decisions of Pinterest</li>
<li>SEO efforts could underperform, search engines could demote pinterest content</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/ecommerce-conversion-funnel/">Funnel Examples</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness: Keep the product at top of mind</li>
<li>Interest:</li>
<li>Desire: emphasize benefits to the user and a call to action. E.g. “sign up for (product) and enjoy (benefits)”</li>
<li>Action:</li>
<li>Example: sessions &gt; sessions with product page view &gt; sessions with Add-To-Cart &gt; sessions with transaction</li>
<li>User flow to see if users behave differently from the first touch</li>
<li>Important metrics: traffic &gt; conversion rate, bounce rate &gt; sales, cart abandonment &gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>7 Growth Strategies from <a href="https://sujanpatel.com/marketing/growth-levers/">here</a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pinterest: Exclusivity. Pinterest began as an invite-only platform.</li>
<li>PayPal: Buy users. PayPal offered monetary rewards to new users. An alternative is cash back, since that first requires a purchase. This can be less than a customer’s LTV tokeep resaonable revenue.</li>
<li>Popcorn Metrics: Deep Onboarding. Working personally with new users, providing videos and tutorials.</li>
<li>SpringShield: viral referral loop. Like Robinhood, can have a waitlist for a new feature and make your position in line contingent on referrals – this induces a competition that favors users who successfully refer more users.</li>
<li>GrooveHQ: Segment marketing emails based on user behavior. Targeted differet users with statistics (time on page, and logins per day) resonent of the users who churned within a 30 day window. Also measured response rate and retention rate among those who responded to the email.</li>
<li>Milkshake: Leverage happy customers for referrals. Using NPS (Net Promoter Score) responses (positive ones, of course) as testimonials. Asking for shares inside Mailshake. Engaging referrers by asking at sign-up if a customer was there via a referral and who gave it, and thanking them via social media and email. Increasing customer/product investment by asking our most active customers for product feedback. Conducting and featuring case studies from our most successful customers.</li>
<li>PicMonkey: Freemium.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/958601754/files/doc_financials/2019/q2/shareholder-letter-Q219-v10.pdf">Letter to shareholders</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced personalized search in home and sidebar.</li>
<li>More video content: user repin rate for videos is 1.4x that of static images. Video views greater in Q2 than all of 2018. Searches for specific terms (paint on canvas) also increased by &gt;300% after video pins on those topics. Big gains in searches in food, style, beauty, and skill learning.</li>
<li>Videos also improve clickthrough rate and can have a lower cost per click for advertisers (ads pay for impressions and ranking, so a higher CTR may imply a lower CPC).</li>
<li>Focusing on growing products from retailers, saw increase of 50% from methods for acquiring pin inventory, which improves relevance and engagement, measured in weekly shopper impressions and clicks.</li>
<li>New <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/summer-shopping">shopping features</a>. Retailers saw <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/blog/research-retail-brands-can-see-2x-higher-returns-on-pinterest-than-other-digital-channels">2x higher return</a> on ad spend with Pinterest vs social media, and 1.3x higher return than on paid search.</li>
<li>New mobile ad manager that increases mobile signup activation rates</li>
<li>Made easier to add tags for ad attribution, 2x more tags added YTD in 2019 than in all of 2018</li>
<li>30% YoY DAU growth to 300m</li>
</ul>
<div id="metrics" class="section level3">
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>MAUs and ARPU depend on the methodology used to track user data, and changes in this methodology can influence Pinterest’s revenue projections.</p>
<p>Retention:</p>
<ul>
<li>MAU: Monthly active users, a logged-in Pinterest user who visits our website or opens our mobile application at least once during the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenue:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARPU: Average revenue per user = revenue in a grography / ((MAU0 + MAU1) / 2)</li>
<li>Where MAU0 is for the same 30 day period as the revenue and MAU1 is for the prior period</li>
</ul>

###


We currently have a button on each Pin on the Pinterest app. It has a click rate of 0.04 (number of clicks / number of pins seen). The only outcomes possible are click or not click.

Q: What is the probability of observing exactly 5 clicks out of 100 pins seen?

100 choose 5 * .04^5 * (1-.04)^(100-5)


Q: What is the probability of observing at least 5 clicks out of 100 pins seen?

1 - sum from i = 0 to 5 (100 choose i * .04^i * (1-.04)^(100-i))


Q: Given that we observe 5 clicks out of 100 pins seen in the treatment group of an experiment, construct a hypothesis test to test whether the button click rate is significantly different than 0.04.


p_0 = 0.04
p = 5/100
n = ? 

z = (p - p_0) / (p_0 * (1-p_0) / sqrt(n) ) 
z = (.05 - .040) / (.04 * (1-.04) / sqrt(n) ) 


Q. Can you describe what alpha of 0.05 means here (i.e., type 1 error rate)? To a data scientist (technical audience)? To a person with no statistical background (non-technical audience)?


Q. Can you describe the outcome of this hypothesis test to a data scientist (i.e., to a technical audience)? To a person with no statistical background (i.e., to a non-technical audience)?

Experimentation

We have been getting feedback from users in focus groups that they’d like to see fresher search results, meaning more up-to-date pins. So we’d like to see how freshness would affect user experience. 

Q: How would you approach this problem?

freshness [?] -&gt; user satisfaction?

1) define freshness

2) metrics to reflect a better user experience

Acquisition
- 

Activation
- time on home page
- boards created
- pins per board
- pins pinned per user

Retention
- repeat logins / week

Referral
- 

Revenue

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Example Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recently graduated from UC Irvine where I studied cognitive science and statistics.</li>
<li>My research focused on decision making, which means I programed experiments that would show people two or three alternatives and vary the attributes of the alternatives to reveal how people are making decisions.</li>
<li>So for example someone might see three different pins – These pins have attributes like different properties of the image, maybe different text captions.</li>
<li>Search for recepies, then I might immediately see 3 pins with food images that have different attributes (carbs, brightness of the image, text, …).</li>
<li><p>Very relevant, which is one of the reasons I’m excited to be interviewing with Pinterest.</p></li>
<li>That overlap between the tasks I created, and the user experience on the pinterest platform is one of the big reasons why I’d be excited to work at Pinterest.</li>
<li><p>Another reason is the proximity of user data to user purchasing decisions (high user intent).</p></li>
<li>UCI</li>
<li>Cognitive science and statistics</li>
<li>My research focused on decision making –</li>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How environmental cues impact impulsivity or preferences for immediate rewards</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Decoy effects – so how the attributes of an undesirable option can influence preference between two desirable options.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Inferring which decision making strategy a person is currently following</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For all of these studies, I was writing programs that would show participants multiple options (e.g. pins) and modify the context (adding other cues) or the attributes of the options to see how those modifications influenced the probability of a person picking one of the options.</li>
<li><p>Very relevant to the kind of environments users experience on Pinterest, which is one of the reasons I’m excited to be interviewing with Pinterest.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the phenomena that I studied was the decoy effect – For example at Pinterest, if a user sees a set of three pins (A,B,C), they pick A 70% of the time and B 30% of the time, but when we just show pins A and B, they pick B 55% of the time and A 45% of the time.</p></li>

<li>(skip) Wanted to attribute conversion to product features with conversion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data:</li>
<li>Company demographic information, company size and revenue.</li>
<li>Used this to communicate conversion rates by demographic to heads of different teams using tables and figures.</li>
<li>Account activity data which was a sum of actions taken within an account each day.</li>
<li>I transformed this into cumulative sum instead of daily sum to increase interpretability and modeling ease.</li>
</ul>
<p>(skip) Action: (skip) - Used cross sections of cumulative account activity data after 7 days since the account was created. (skip) - Cast as classification problem, used SMOTE to address class imbalance, (skip) - used 5-fold CV to evaluate models on AUC, (skip) - ended with a RF algorithm for these predictions.</p>
<p>Result:</p>

<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids do seem to switch strategies, probably don’t act optimally, and have different strategies depending on age (switchy vs sticky)</li>
<li>Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time.</li>

<h3>Explain some research at Pintrest</h3>
<p>See:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://labs.pinterest.com/user/themes/pin_labs/assets/paper/pinning-www17.pdf">Predicting Intent Using Activity Logs</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Pinterest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content sharing platform, and image based search engine</li>
<li>Prior research found user types; 1) casual browsers, 2) responding to a specific goals</li>
<li>Prior research found different temporal horizons, e.g. using Pintrest to plan dinner versus using Pintrest to plan vacations.</li>
<li>On Pintrest users view pins (content) to boards (collections).</li>
<li>Pins have 33 categories (DIY, food and drink, …)</li>
<li>Users can look at closeups of Pins, which provides additional information</li>
<li>Users can click through to visit a site affiliated with a pin</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem and volue of a solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can use a product with different intents, and the material that a user finds valuable may depend on their intent.</li>
<li>Being able to infer a user’s intent from their behavior during a session would enable a personalized experience aligned with a user’s goals.</li>
<li>Example: Someone looking for dinner recepies might want something they can quickly make with common ingredients, while someone looking for potluck ideas might want more unique dishes, and someone who is just browsing food might prefer a variety of exotic food images.</li>
<li>User intent can vary with each session, so quickly identifying intent within a session can help with changing the interface and content shown to the user in real time based on their inferred intent</li>
</ul>
<p>Current paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goals: Understand how intent informs behavior, and whether intent can be inferred from behavior.</li>
<li>Two dimensions of intent:</li>
<li>Goal specificity: whether the intent is stimulus specific (glutin free chocolate chip recepies) or vague (just browsing to pass time).</li>
<li>and temporal range: Time horizon for goal completion (tonight, next week, next month, …).</li>
<li>In psych, motivation is defined as a directing and activating or invigorating force. The directional component maps onto what Pintrest is calling goal specificity, and the invigorating component might map onto the inverse of what Pintrest refers to as temporal range.</li>
<li>In psych, there’s a notion of goal-directed and habitual behavior. The former is driven by a specific desired outcome (similar to goal specificity here) while the later is a less mindful response to stimuli (eg boredom triggers a passive arousal seeking).</li>
<li>In social psych, attitudes have been thought about along a gradient of specificity – so maybe things like time-related words in a query can be used to identify goal-directed users.</li>
<li>Shopping websites can be used for a specific purchase (goal-directed) or in an experiential way (habitual).</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample: 5369 females mean age 33.5, 564 males mean age 38.6, all from US and on Pintrest during July 2016</li>
<li>Survey asking;</li>
<li>7 point likert scale: “Are you visiting Pintrest with a goal in mind?”</li>
<li>“When are you planning to act on what you’re looking for today”</li>
<li>Question about Pintrest specific motivations (eg finding DIY ideas)</li>
<li>“What are you looking for on Pintrest today?” Response options were based on Pintrest categories</li>
<li>Focused on data in the session immediately following the survey</li>
<li>primarily analyzed first 10 minutes because this window had peak performance, around 27% of sessions had fewer than 10 minutes</li>
<li>Over 850,000 behavioral events (views, closeups, searches) across 5933 users within 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Also analyzed behavior from when the user first created account until a week after survey completion</li>
<li>used Holm-corrected p-values, a method that is more powerful than a the conservative Bonferroni correction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigating limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>coverage bias: mitigated by uniformly sampling from users for inclusion</li>
<li>participation bias: compared activity of users who completed the survey (addigned survey, took survey) to those who saw the survey popup but did not complete the survey (assigned survey, did not take survey).</li>
<li>Survey takers had been using Pintrest longer, and had more saved pins. Inferred from this that engaged users were</li>
</ul>
<p>Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal-specific users are: more focused, search more (1.1 vs 0.4 searches), spend more time browsing specific categories of content in detail, more likely to reference saved content, less likely to return in next 7 days, less likely to attribute their visit to boredom (2% vs 25% for habitual), more likely to attribute visit to making something (26% vs 5% for habitual)</li>
<li>users with short term goals: specific categories of content, likely to reference saved content, less likely to save new content, goal-specific users more likely to act in short term, habitual users more unsure of taking actions</li>
<li>Demographic differences: females more likely to be goal-specific (49% vs 40%), males unsure of taking action, older users more short-term goals, younger users more unsure of taking action, food, drink, DIY searches more likely to be goal-specific and act in short term, travel, entertainment more likely to be habitual and likely to act in long term, intent moderates the type of recepies users save</li>
<li>Model can predict goal specificity and temporal range.</li>
<li>Current session data is most informative, historical activity data also helpful</li>
