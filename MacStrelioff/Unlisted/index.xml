      <description>TODO: redo in Python, make an agent that uses each strategy as a method. Build the agent throughout the script.   Bandit Algorithms Much of this is from this blog.
Here I evaluate different algorithms for bandit problems similar to those anticipated in industry or testing settings. Criteria of consideration are;
Problem Formalization Bandit tasks can be cast as a Markov Decision Process.
\[ \begin{aligned} t &amp;amp;\in \{1,...,T\} \\ a_t &amp;amp;\in \mathcal{A} \\ s_t &amp;amp;\in \mathcal{S} \\ r_t &amp;amp;= R(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t) = v(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t) \\ T(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t) &amp;amp;= p(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t) \\ \pi(s_t)&amp;amp;=p(a_t|s_t) \end{aligned} \]</description>

      <description> What are Metrics? Metrics are how the data scientist communicates with project managers.
Two categories; success and tracking.
Goals are defined in terms of metrics, and user experience is understood through metrics.
Success Metrics  Tracking Metrics   Metrics for Goals  Metrics for Insights  Communicating Metrics Idea from:
 Add metrics from google analytics, and youtube creator.

      <description>Probability Theory and Information Theory Types of Probabilities and Their Computations motivation? Many important variables (future income, GDP, who I’ll marry, whether I’ll get sick, what disease I have given some symptoms, …)
 Randomness, Event Spaces, and Probability motivating example.. Imagine that a vaccine against a dangerous disease recently becomes available. However, there is a small risk that the vaccine will produce a condition just as bad as the disease itself.</description>

      <description>Recommendation Sort Algorithms Search Algorithms Ranking Algorithms   Recommendation Lots of recommendation algorithms
Data science methods play a major role in discovering recommendations for users.
Econ, compliments and substitutes (competitors).
Types of recommendation; compliments (these go together), competitors (you might also like…), temporal (might buy this again in the future). Horizontal and vertical focus
Temporal involves forecasting, which is a topic for another post.
