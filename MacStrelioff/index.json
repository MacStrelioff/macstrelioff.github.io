An event is an observed value of a random variable. An event space contains all possible values of the random variable. Probabilities are values assigned to the events in an event space (i.e. the possible values of a random variable) and represent how likely each event is relative to other events in the event space.\nHere \\(p(e)\\) will be used to represent the probability of an event. Some special probabilities include the probability of any event in the event space, which is 1. And the probability of any event other than \\(p(e)\\), known as the compliment of \\(p(e)\\), denoted with \\(p(\\neg e)\\), is found by;\n\\[ p(\\neg e) = 1 - p(e) \\]\nProbability Rules A joint event refers to two or more events occurring together. They are colloquially talked about as one event ‘and’ another event occurring together. More formally, joint events are called intersections (represented with the \\(\\cap\\) symbol) between events. For events \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), the probability of their joint event will be represented with \\(p(e_1 \\cap e_2)\\). The probability of an intersection of events is the same regardless of which event is considered first;\n\\[ p(e_1 \\cap e_2) = p(e_2 \\cap e_1) \\]\nFor two events, \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), their intersection is found by; \\[ p(e_1 \\\u0026amp; e_2) = p(e_1\\cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) \\] where \\(p(e_1|e_2)\\) is a conditional probability, discussed in the next section.\nConditional events refer to one event, \\(e_1\\), after another event, \\(e_2\\), is known. \\(p(e_1|e_2)\\) represents the probability of \\(e_1\\) given, or after knowing, \\(e_2\\). These can be defined by rearranging the multiplication rule as follows; \\[ p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2)=p(e_1\\cap e_2) \\Rightarrow p(e_1|e_2)= \\frac{p(e_1\\cap e_2)}{p(e_2)} \\]\nNoting that, by the reflexively of joint events and the definition of the multiplication rule, \\(p(e_1 \\cap e_2) = p(e_2 \\cap e_1)= p(e_2 | e_1) p(e_1)\\), and so the above equation becomes; \\[ p(e_1|e_2)=\\frac{p(e_2 | e_1) p(e_1)}{p(e_2)} \\] This equation is known as Bayes’ Theorem or Bayes’ Rule.\nA union (represented with the \\(\\cup\\) symbol) of events refers to at least one of multiple events occurring. For events, \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), their union would include the probability that \\(e_1\\) occurs, the probability that or \\(e_2\\) occurs, and the probability that both \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) occur. Colloquially this is talked about the probability of \\(e_1\\) ‘or’ \\(e_2\\). Formally this is expressed and computed as; \\[ p(e_1\\text{ or } e_2) = p(e_1 \\cup e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1 \\cap e_2) \\]\nWhere \\(p(e_1 \\cap e_2)\\) is a joint probability.\nIndependence is a common assumption in many statistical techniques. Statisticians assume independence primarily because it simplifies the computation of certain probabilities. Events are said to be independent if knowing one event does not change the probability of the other event. Formally, if events \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are independent, this would mean that; \\[ \\begin{aligned} p(e_1|e_2) \u0026amp;= p(e_1) \\\\ p(e_2|e_1) \u0026amp;= p(e_2) \\end{aligned} \\]\nIf \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are independent, then their joint probability simplifies as so; \\[ p(e_1 \\cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) = p(e_1)p(e_2) \\] Where the last equality is only true if \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are independent (i.e. \\(p(e_1|e_2)=p(e_1)\\)).\nThen the probability of their union simplifies to; \\[ \\begin{aligned} p(e_1 \\cup e_2) \u0026amp;= p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) \\\\ \u0026amp;= p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1)p(e_2) \\end{aligned} \\] Where again, the last part of this equality is only true if \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are independent.\nEvents \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of either event precludes the occurrence of the other event. Formally mutual exclusivity means that; \\[ p(e_1 | e_2) = 0 \\text{ and } p(e_2 | e_1) = 0 \\]\nIf two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of their joint event is; \\[ \\begin{aligned} p(e_1 \\cap e_2) \u0026amp;= p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) \\\\ \u0026amp;= 0*p(e_2) \\\\ \u0026amp;= 0 \\end{aligned} \\]\nAnd the probability of their union simplifies to; \\[ \\begin{aligned} p(e_1 \\cup e_2) \u0026amp;= p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1 \\cap e_2) \\\\ \u0026amp;= p(e_1) + p(e_2) - 0 \\\\ \u0026amp;=p(e_1) + p(e_2) \\end{aligned} \\]\n Probability Functions Here I’ll describe the properties and use cases for probability functions and cumulative probability functions. Conventionally, use \\(f(x)\\) is used represent a probability function, and \\(F(x)\\) to represent a cumulative probability function. \\(f(x)\\) is commonly called a probability mass function (pmf) if \\(x\\) is discrete, and a probability density function (pdf) if \\(x\\) is continuous. \\(f(x)\\) and \\(F(x)\\) are related through integration:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} f(x) \u0026amp;= \\frac{d}{dx}F(x) \\\\ F(x) \u0026amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) d_{x} \\end{aligned} \\]\nFor discrete variables, the probability function represents the probability that \\(X\\) takes a specific value \\(x\\): \\(f(x) = p(X=x)\\). For continuous variables, the probability that the variable \\(X\\) takes any particular value is technically \\(0\\); \\(p(X=x)=0\\). However, \\(p(x)\\) is still related to probability functions \\(f(x)\\) through areas. For an arbitrarily small \\(\\epsilon\\) the probability that \\(X\\) takes a value between \\(x-\\epsilon\\) and \\(x+\\epsilon\\) is the area of the distribution over that range;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} p( x - \\epsilon\u0026lt; x \u0026lt; x+\\epsilon) \u0026amp;= F(x+\\epsilon) - F(x-\\epsilon) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{(x-+\\epsilon)}f(x)d_{x} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{(x-\\epsilon)}f(x)d_{x} \\end{aligned} \\]\nProbability functions have to satisfy a few conditions:\n     Expectation For any functions of a randome variable, \\(g(x)\\), the expectation of that function is;\n\\[ E_{x}(g(x))=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}g(x)f(x)d_{x} \\]\nFor discrete random variables, \\(E(x)=\\sum_xxp(x)\\). For continuous random variables, \\(f(x)dx\\) is conceptually \\(p(x)\\) since it is the area under an infinately small segment of the probability function if \\(f(x)\\) represents the height and \\(dx\\) represents an infinately small width.\nExpectation is a linear operator, so for constants \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and random variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\); \\(E(ax+by+c) = aE(x)+bE(y)+c\\).\nExpectation for joint random variables\n\\[ E_{x,y}(g(x,y))=\\int_{s=x}\\int_{t=y}g(s,t)f(s,t)d_{s}d_{t} \\]\nMarginalizing a distribution from a joint probability function (\\(f(x,y)\\)) or a conditional probability function (\\(f(x|y)\\)): \\[ \\begin{aligned} f_x(x)\u0026amp;=\\int_yf_{x,y}(x,y)d_{y}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\int_y f_{x|y}(x|y)f_y(y)d_{y}\\\\ \u0026amp;=E_y(f(x|y)) \\end{aligned} \\]\nLaw of total expectation, and rough proof\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} E_{x}(x)\u0026amp;=E_{y}(E_{x|y}(x|y))\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\int_y\\int_{x}xf_{x|y}(x|y)d_{x}f(y)d_{y} \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\int_{x}x\\int_{y}f_{x|y}(x|y)f(y)d_{y}d_{x} \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\int_{x}xf(x)d_{x}\\\\ \u0026amp;=E_{x}(x) \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe last steps reflect that the internal integral is just marginalizing across y; \\(f_x(x)=\\int_y f_{x|y}(x|y)f_y(y)d_{y}\\).\n Variance Covariance and variance\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} Cov(X,Y)\u0026amp;=E_{x,y}((X-E_{x}(X))(Y-E_{y}(Y)))\\\\ Var(X)\u0026amp;=Cov(X,X)=E_{x}((X-E_{x}(X))^2) \\\\ \u0026amp;= E(X^2)-E(X)^2 \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe Bias-Variance tradeoff decomposes the theoretical variance obtained when estimating a function \\(g(x)\\) with a model \\(\\hat{g}(x)\\) into three components that can be used to motivated changes to the model. Specifically, the Bias-Variance tradeoff is a decomposition of the expected prediction error; \\(g(x)-\\hat{g}(x)\\). To see it’s relation to variance, first rearrange the variance equation above:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} Var(X)= E(X^2)-E(X)^2 \\\\ \\Rightarrow E(X^2) = Var(X)+E(X)^2 \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nThen define the random variable \\(X\\) to be the errors of the model;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} E((g(x)-\\hat{g}(x))^2) \u0026amp;= Var((g(x)-\\hat{g}(x))^2)+E((g(x)-\\hat{g}(x)))^2 \\\\ \u0026amp;= (g(x)-E(\\hat{g}(x)))^2 + E((E(\\hat{g}(x))-\\hat{g}(x))^2) + Var(g(x))\\\\ \u0026amp;= Bias(\\hat{g}(x))^2 + Var(\\hat{g}(x)) + Var(g(x)) \\end{aligned} \\]\nHere bias represents the squared error between the true function \\(g(x)\\) and the expected model \\(E(\\hat{g}(x))\\). Variance represents the squared error between the expected model and the obtained model. And \\(Var(g(x))\\) represents the true noise or irreducible error in the process \\(g(x)\\).\nVariance of linear combinations of random variables:\n\\[ Var(aX+bY+c)=a^2Var(X)+b^2Var(Y)+2abCov(X,Y) \\]\nVariance is also crucial for designing experiments, for example if \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) have different signs and \\(Cov(X,Y)\u0026gt;0\\), then the variance between is reduced because the covariance is subtracted off. This is a justification for within-participant designs, where \\(X\\) represents the first measurement, \\(Y\\) represents a future measurement, \\(a=-1\\) and \\(b=1\\) to reflect a difference comparing the second and first measurements (\\(Y-X\\)), and since the measurements come from the same person here, it is reasonable to assume they are correlated (\\(Cov(X,Y)\u0026gt;0\\)). In this case, \\(Var(X,Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)-Cov(X,Y)\\), which is not larger than the variance that would be obtained if the measurements were from independent samples.\nLaw of total variance: The variance of a variable \\(X\\) can be decomposed into the variation in the variable that remains when \\(Y\\) is known or irreducible error (\\(E(Var(X|Y))\\)), and the variation that carries through from the uncertainty in the model estimation \\(Y\\) (\\(Var(E(X|Y)\\)). \\[ \\begin{aligned} Var(X)\u0026amp;=E(Var(X|Y))+Var(E(X|Y)) \\end{aligned} \\]\nThis arises in hierarchical models and prediction intervals.\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} x \u0026amp;\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)\\\\ E(x) \u0026amp;=\\mu\\\\ Var(x) \u0026amp;=\\sigma^2\\\\ \\hat{\\mu}_n \u0026amp;\\sim N\\left(\\mu,\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\\\ E(\\hat{\\mu}_n) \u0026amp;=\\mu\\\\ Var(\\hat{\\mu}_n)\u0026amp;=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\\\ E(x_{n+1}) \u0026amp;= E(E(x_{n+1}|\\hat{\\mu}_n))= E(\\hat{\\mu}_n)=\\mu \\\\ Var(x_{n+1}) \u0026amp;=E(Var(x_{n+1})) + Var(E(x_{n+1}|\\mu_{n})\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\sigma^2+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\\\ (100-\\alpha)PI: \u0026amp; E(x_{n+1}|\\hat{\\mu}_n) \\pm T_\\alpha \\sqrt{Var(x_{n+1})}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\n Information Theory Information or Surprise is a measure of how unexpected an event was: \\[ I(x)=-log(f(x))=log\\left(\\frac{1}{f(x)} \\right) \\]\nEntropy is the expected surprise – higher entropy relates to more uncertainty: \\[ H(X)=E(I(x)) = E(-log(f(x))) = \\int_X f(x)I(x)dx = -\\int_X f(x)log(f(x))d_x \\]\nK-L Divergance, or relative entropy, is the expected distance between distributions with respect to one of the distributions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} D_{KL}(f_{x}(x);f_{y}(x)) \u0026amp;= \\int_{X} f_{x}(x)log\\left(\\frac{f_{y}(x)}{f_{x}(x)} \\right)d_x\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\int_X f_{x}(x)(log(f_{y}(x))-log(f_{x}(x))d_x \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nDivergance is an important concept in machine learning, because it can be a loss function when we are estimating a distribution \\(f(x)\\) with a model \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\). From a Bayesian perspective, Divergance between a prior and posterior measures the information gained by observing the data. Bayesian experimental design focuses on collecting data that maximizes the divergance between the posterior and prior, i.e. the most informative data.\nMutual Information is the divergance from the joint distribution \\(f_{x,y}(x,y)\\) to the joint when independence is assumed \\(f_x(x)f_y(y)\\) – i.e. a measure of non-independence; \\[ I(x;y)=\\int_{y} \\int_{x} f_{x,y}(x,y)log\\left(\\frac{f(x,y)}{f(x)f(y)} \\right)d_yd_x \\]\n  Causal Inference The ultimate goal of most statistical work is to discover the causes of some outcome so that the outcome can be controlled. Hence, it is important to understand when causality can be inferred.\nFrom this perspective, there is a treatment assignment \\(T\\) and an outcome of interest that depends on the treatment \\(Y(T)\\). Ideally, we would be able to compute the expected treatment effeoct for any individual \\(E(Y(T=1)-Y(T=0))\\), but it is impossible to assign an individual to both variants of the treatment under the exact same conditions – e.g. one must be done at a later time than the other. Causal inference approaches specify the assumptions, models, and designs neeed to make causal statements.\nMost methods like t-tests and ANOVAs compare the observed outcomes in the treatment group to the observed outcomes in the control group. Causal inference methods can give a more powerful comparison between observed outcomes and counterfactual outcomes CI video at 10:00.\nCommon Methods Some summarized in this Medium Post\nDiff in Diff Contexts and example ..\nAssumptions:\n The trend in the control group is an appropriate proxy for the trend in the treatment group, had the treatment not occurred.

Assumptions and requirements:\n Requires other time series related to the target time series Assumes the other time series are not influenced by the treatment, generally good candidates include; google trends time series, the weather, other countries or markets where no action was taken, unemployment indecies, stock prices, … .  Model:\n In pre period, train any kind of model to estimate the target time series as a function of the other time series. The model used in the Causal Impact package is a Bayesian structural time series model. Google’s Causal Impact method uses Bayesian structural time series to construct a counterfactual group – an estimate of what the time series would have looked like if the treatment had not been assigned. The method is described in this video. The method estimates a counterfactual using other related time series that were not influenced by the treatment. BSTS uses spike and slab prior for feature selection. In post period, use the model to estimate a counterfactual time series (i.e. synthetic control).

Overall I was more interested in naturally occurring datasets, and experimental design – how we structude and verify our beliefs, and then use those beliefs to guide our actions. So here at X that might look like using naturally occurring user data to develop and validate models that inform choices about product design. I really like diving into a new theory or model and gaining an redicovering the intuition from some first principles. I also love finding connections between seemingly desparate fields or ideas. This is one of the reasons I was drawn to math and statistics – the same formal patterns and expressions are manifested in so many diverse applications. During graduate school I contributed to a number of projects (behavioral econ, strategy inference, RL, … ) and learned about theories that have real applications – how people make decisions with tradeoffs, how specific ways of delivering reward can influence behavior. I’m also deeply interested in the right way to justify a decision or belief – this is something that propelled my interest in experimentation, Bayesian statistics, and causal inference.\n My mission is to break down barriers, mainly by democratizing education. About me: UCI, recorded lectures for students, stats masters, data scientist, … About this channel: I’ll primarily use this channel to publish educational resources on statistics and programming, mainly for aspiring data scientists. I’ll also use this channel as a platform to discuss hobby projects related to data science.\n   Data Science Interview Walkthrough Series I realized there was a lot of material to help prepare for software engineering videos, but very little for data scientist interviews. So I’m compiling videos of interview questions my firends and I have been asked in data sicence interviews, and questions that I’ve gotten from data scientists who are currently interviewing.\n Target Audience: People who want to know more about data scientist interviews Marketing: Post on Facebook, LinkedIn data science interest groups  Value:\n “I have a masters in statistics and a PhD in cognitive science” (can I add results to this?) My credability: Do an ‘about me’ video where I talk about my work at UCI, masters degree in statistics. “To make these videos the mose valuable use of your time, I’m focusing exclusively on questions and content that have come up during interviews.”  “Data Scientist Interview Walkthrough: Intro”  When I was studying to be a data scientist, I realized that there were lots of resources with loads of material that won’t actually help in an interview because they were too vague or too theoretical, or just contained very little material that actually comes up in an interview. I also noticed that there are plenty of walkthroughs for the problems that come up in software engineering interviews, but nothing like that for data science interviews. So with this series, I’m creating videos that will walk you through the questions that are currently coming up in silicone valley data scientist interviews To make this the most valuable use of your time, I’ll be walking through questions that have come up in my interviews, or in my friends interviews, as well as questions that I gotten from data scientists and product managers who are actively interviewing. This way these videos are going to be the most relevant and helpful resource for you if you want to learn what it takes to excel in a data science interview. So.. what are these videos? Each video will start with a question. I’d recommend pausing the video and trying the question yourself for a few minutes, and then watching my walkthrough for the question. As I walk through the questions, I’ll mention the concepts that the questions are testing for so that you can note them and dive into those later. Now, some of the best questions start easy and become progressively harder, so what that means here is that, if you don’t watch to the end then you might miss surprises that an interviewer can throw at you, that the people who aren’t watching my videos won’t be expecting. So for now, I would recommend watching the videos, trying the problems, and seeing how I walkthrough solutions, and watching through the end so that there aren’t any unexpected surprises If you find this helpful or interesting, like this video so that I know that the work I put into this series is having a good impact for you and other people Also, if there are questions that you have encountered and want answered, comment them below so that I can get you a walkthrough!

On Pintrest users view pins (content) to boards (collections). Pins have 33 categories (DIY, food and drink, …) Users can look at closeups of Pins, which provides additional information Users can click through to visit a site affiliated with a pin  Problem and volue of a solution:\n Users can use a product with different intents, and the material that a user finds valuable may depend on their intent. Being able to infer a user’s intent from their behavior during a session would enable a personalized experience aligned with a user’s goals. Example: Someone looking for dinner recepies might want something they can quickly make with common ingredients, while someone looking for potluck ideas might want more unique dishes, and someone who is just browsing food might prefer a variety of exotic food images. User intent can vary with each session, so quickly identifying intent within a session can help with changing the interface and content shown to the user in real time based on their inferred intent  Current paper:\n Goals: Understand how intent informs behavior, and whether intent can be inferred from behavior. Two dimensions of intent: Goal specificity: whether the intent is stimulus specific (glutin free chocolate chip recepies) or vague (just browsing to pass time). and temporal range: Time horizon for goal completion (tonight, next week, next month, …). In psych, motivation is defined as a directing and activating or invigorating force. The directional component maps onto what Pintrest is calling goal specificity, and the invigorating component might map onto the inverse of what Pintrest refers to as temporal range. In psych, there’s a notion of goal-directed and habitual behavior. The former is driven by a specific desired outcome (similar to goal specificity here) while the later is a less mindful response to stimuli (eg boredom triggers a passive arousal seeking). In social psych, attitudes have been thought about along a gradient of specificity – so maybe things like time-related words in a query can be used to identify goal-directed users. Shopping websites can be used for a specific purchase (goal-directed) or in an experiential way (habitual).  Methods:\n Sample: 5369 females mean age 33.5, 564 males mean age 38.6, all from US and on Pintrest during July 2016 Survey asking; 7 point likert scale: “Are you visiting Pintrest with a goal in mind?” “When are you planning to act on what you’re looking for today” Question about Pintrest specific motivations (eg finding DIY ideas) “What are you looking for on Pintrest today?” Response options were based on Pintrest categories Focused on data in the session immediately following the survey primarily analyzed first 10 minutes because this window had peak performance, around 27% of sessions had fewer than 10 minutes Over 850,000 behavioral events (views, closeups, searches) across 5933 users within 10 minutes. Also analyzed behavior from when the user first created account until a week after survey completion used Holm-corrected p-values, a method that is more powerful than a the conservative Bonferroni correction.  Mitigating limitations:\n coverage bias: mitigated by uniformly sampling from users for inclusion participation bias: compared activity of users who completed the survey (addigned survey, took survey) to those who saw the survey popup but did not complete the survey (assigned survey, did not take survey). Survey takers had been using Pintrest longer, and had more saved pins. Inferred from this that engaged users were  Findings:\n Goal-specific users are: more focused, search more (1.1 vs 0.4 searches), spend more time browsing specific categories of content in detail, more likely to reference saved content, less likely to return in next 7 days, less likely to attribute their visit to boredom (2% vs 25% for habitual), more likely to attribute visit to making something (26% vs 5% for habitual) users with short term goals: specific categories of content, likely to reference saved content, less likely to save new content, goal-specific users more likely to act in short term, habitual users more unsure of taking actions Demographic differences: females more likely to be goal-specific (49% vs 40%), males unsure of taking action, older users more short-term goals, younger users more unsure of taking action, food, drink, DIY searches more likely to be goal-specific and act in short term, travel, entertainment more likely to be habitual and likely to act in long term, intent moderates the type of recepies users save Model can predict goal specificity and temporal range.

Search those keywords on vidIQ   keyword is the the search query, er the target search query Use vidiq to determine search volume potential on video keywords\n Google search volume is not always indicative of interest in a topic on Youtube so it’s not a good idea to rely on it for choosing video keywords Keywords that have video carousels in the Google SERPS can increase CTR of a video and pull in more views   Title:  instead of ‘part 1, ..’ find seperate videos that can rank on their own, maybe try ‘question 1’ so they sound self-contained title case – capitalize first letter of all words in title Video is shorter than 60 characters so it isn’t cut off in the SERP Video contains your target keyword Remove excess jargon See SEO Framework/YouTube Distribution section - in the expanded section in middle of page - for examples. Do not include episode numbers for your videos that are in playlists. CTR and views might go down as episode numbers go up and the playlist is already directing the order in which your audience views so there’s no need to really include the numbers Briggsby found that titles with 47-48 characters perform best. This has not been reflected in our own videos so far but this is still a good target range to adhere to as a best practices. Front-load your keyword in your title if possible. Youtube gives more weight to words that come at the beginning of the title. Don’t do this if it comes at the expense of the flow of your title or users’ understanding of your title. Note that your title in the video description can be different than what appears in the thumbnail (to make the title visually more succinct)   Description  in description, overview of everything, links of anything you want to push people to, timestamps for parts of the video. longer descriptions better for ranking bc youtube, sweet spot ~350 words. Include your target keyword in first line and give an overview of what topics your video will cover Descriptions that consist of 200-350 may to improve rankings Your description should not give away so much of the content of your video that people no longer need to watch to get the bulk of the information Link at the front, so that it isn’t cut off Including time stamps in your video can help prevent people who just want to understand one topic from your video from bouncing off the page when they don’t get the answers they want immediately (this is good for longer videos)\n Add summary with timecodes in the description timecodes\n  From this blog - Brief CTA for a relevant next video to drive session length and related videos. - Subscribe CTA to help build your distribution power. - 50 to 150 words in the description to summarize and describe your video, mentioning a broad match variation of your keyword 1 to 3 times, depending on length. - List additional videos to watch, focused on your best content about the same or a similar subject matter as this video, creating recommendation clusters. - A brief bio and/or list of social accounts, which can help build your distribution power. - Avoid exceeding 400 words without a good reason to do so, because stuffing or going broadly off topic can harm performance.\n Tags  Look at “view page source” and find their keywords. type key words in youtube search, and add the things that it suggests. keyword  long tail keywords  2-3 broadest category ones focus on 6-8 tags\n Include 6-8 tags Use this formula: 1st tag - target keyword, 2nd + 3rd tags - synonyms for your target keyword, 4th + 5th tags - related long tail keywords, 6th + 7th keywords - broad categories that your video fits into Use ‘page inspector’ option in Chrome to look up keywords used in high traffic videos on related topics! This increases your chances of being placed as a suggested video for that video\n   Higher Ranking Good advice from joma here\nvideo guidelines for higher ranking:\n add 5-10s pauses to let users try the problems on their own (and to increase view time) ask users to subscribe sell likes and subscriptions: “As you can imagine, it takes a lot of time and effort to make these videos.

In this series I walk through problems that reflect those that are currently being asked in data scientist interviews at highly competitive companies. After watching these interview question walkthroughs, you’ll be able to confidently brease through your technical interviews. Many resources, can be overwhelming and ultimately a waste of time because much of that material won’t ever come up. My goal is to make these videos the highest return on your time by focusing on content that my friends and I have seen in interviews.    CTR Thumbnails guide here\nFace in a small frame over written math Face large, with text formulas around it  For a background photo, choose something with blues, greens, and high contrast, and maybe face shapes e.g. search: blue green smoke black background face\n From Jessica: Use bold text that can be read in a variety of different sizes Use high resolution pictures Use colors that contrast against the Youtube website color scheme of red and white Yellow, green, orange, purple pink and blue Use high contrast photos Many experts recommend including people/faces in thumbnails to increase CTR. However, we tried this with the Kanban series and did not see CTR increase so the jury is out.\n Find a high contrast background, and maybe in ppt, put a title in white font on a black box in the center?\n   Brand Consistency   Within Videos Duration  Do an incognito tab search in Youtube for your target keyword and note the average duration of the top three videos. This should give you a good idea of an appropriate duration for the type of content you’re creating Videos should be at least 4:30 long According to Briggsby: The average duration of videos that rank in the top 5 is 11 minutes and 44 seconds, and there appears to be a positive relationship between video length and rank performance. Audiences also tend to “like” videos more that are in the 10-16 minute range However, keep in mind that you should tailor your video duration to be appropriate for the type of content you are creating and that’s why you should always be sure to note how long the videos are that are ranking for your target keyword   Hook and Intro Context: “This video is part of a series where I work though common and current Data Science interview questions. If you’d like to see more, feel free to like so that I know the these videos are having an impact, and to subscribe if you want to see the latest videos.” Credibility “I have a PhD in Cognitive Science and a Masters in Statistics, currently a fellow in a sillicon valley data science bootcamp, where I’m actively interviewing, and networking with data scientists who conduct interviews.” Need / Value: “I realized other content sucks, and this is the best use of your time.” Legitimacy: “This is a question that I got from an interview”   start with an overview of the video. start with what they want for the hook – then ask to like/subscribe at the end for the people that obviously like.\n Hook your audience in the first 10 seconds but don’t give away the answer to the central question of the video that early or your audience will bounce You shouldn’t string them along for too long because you want your video to get to the point, but you don’t want to lose them within the first 10 seconds\n Playlists can help increase the amount of time that your viewers stay on Youtube and, in turn, improve your rankings However, be sure that you keep your playlists focused around one highly-specific topic. If you switch up the topic too much, we see high drop-off and videos end up looking ineffective to the Youtube algorithm. Additionally, if you’re creating a playlist, make sure that videos can stand alone as well within the context of the playlist. If they’re ranking for a standalone keyword, they won’t always appear within the context of your video and you don’t want people to bounce because they feel like they need to have watched 4 or 5 previous videos in order to understand the one that they landed on Writing a script is highly recommended. By sharing your script and refining your opening, you avoid the risk of shooting footage without a clear, strong opening\n   Content  biggest spikes are when there’s new visual information..\n Mention emotions and feelings through a video “At this point you feel like you’re doing well, then …” Speak in a desirable way – engaging or calm. Emphasize value of the content at every step. Pause for them to try and also to increase view time metric\n   End Screen Some advice from YouTube\n Create a custom end screen with bold text to clearly indicate your calls to action Next video to watch and subscriber buttons are good ones If possible have your end screen pop up on the side while your video is still going on, instead of coming on against a static screen. According to Youtube expert Tim Schmoyer, this can increase engagement and prevent people from clicking away from your video Focus on your two most important call to actions instead of bombarding your viewers with too many options Make sure to hold your “subscribe” element in your end screen (see end screen example here) for at least 5 seconds before cutting away.   General tips  Write everything out (maybe in a slightly vague way), and then spend time explaining the terms. From analytics, long periods of writing seem to hurt user retention.

Strategy Inference Project:\n Situation: Project: Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions. I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time. Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time. Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user’s decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings. More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings.

Found the common S shaped calibration curve that comes up in lab experiments, particularly at 1-2 days before market expiration. Result: Value to Yelp: Relates to the economic patterns maybe?  Strategy Inference Project:\n Situation: Project: Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions. I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time. Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time. Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user’s decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings. More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings.  General interest in decision making:\n Situation: Models of multi-alternative decision making are often applied to food preferences to see how people integrate information about price, healthyness, flavor, … . Excitement: Yelp is basically a giant experiment in multiattribute decision making. Value to Yelp: Theoretical insights might help in guiding how restaurant informaiton is displayed to consumers.  Insight Project:\n User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features   Product metrics or experimentation “You have a good chance of getting a product metrics or experimentation question based on some actual questions Yelp is tackling at the moment.”\n General questions:    Deep Dive Stakeholders and Use Cases  Consumers: Delivery: Stores:   User Flows and Metrics Thinking of the broader user flow can help with identifying measurable events within that flow (metrics).

Big-O notation is adapted from mathematics where \\(O(f(n))\\) is used to represent the terms that remain relevant when taking a limit of the computations required by the algorithm, \\(f(n)\\), as \\(n\\) approaches \\(\\infty\\). The same notation is used for time complexity (number of operations) and for space complexity (memory requirements).\nComputational Complexity Here I’ll check the number of computations required by algorithms of different complexities.\nns_to_test = [0,1,10,20] Constant Time: O(1) \\(O(1)\\) represents comstant time complexity – a component of an algorithm that is only performed once, regardless of the input size.\ndef constant_example(n): num_ops = 1 # 1 operation num_ops +=1 # 1 operation return num_ops # total: 2 operations for n in ns_to_test: out=constant_example(n) print(\u0026#39;f({}): {}\u0026#39;.format(n,out)) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(0): 2 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(1): 2 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(10): 2 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(20): 2  Logrithmic Time: O(log(n)) Very slowly increases in computational demand. It can result from splitting the input on each recusrive call.\ndef log_example(n,num_ops=0): # 1 operation per call # if n\u0026gt;1, half n and recursively call again if n\u0026gt;=1: n/=2; num_ops += 1 num_ops += log_example(n) return num_ops for n in ns_to_test: out=log_example(n) print(\u0026#39;f({}): {}\u0026#39;.format(n,out)) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(0): 0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(1): 1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(10): 4 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(20): 5  Polynomial Time: O(n), O(n^2), … good hackerrank video with explanation of polynomial complexity for a recursive solution to fibbinochi\nEach for loop scales complexity by a factor of \\(n\\), so one loop would be linear (\\(O(n)\\)), two loops would be quadratic \\(O(n^2)\\), and three loops would be cubic (\\(O(n^3)\\)), and so on. The example below is a quadratic time example.\ndef linear_example(n): num_ops = 0 # initialize counter for i in range(n): # n times, perform... num_ops +=1 # 1 operation (n*1) return num_ops # 1+n*1 = 1+n operations, O(n) for n in ns_to_test: out=linear_example(n) print(\u0026#39;f({}): {}\u0026#39;.format(n,out)) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(0): 0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(1): 1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(10): 10 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(20): 20 def quadratic_example(n): num_ops = 0 # initialize counter for i in range(n): # n times for j in range(n): # n times (n*n) num_ops+=1 # 1 operation (1*n*n) return num_ops # total 1 + 1*n + 1*n*n, O(n^2) for n in ns_to_test: out=quadratic_example(n) print(\u0026#39;f({}): {}\u0026#39;.format(n,out)) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(0): 0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(1): 1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(10): 100 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(20): 400  Exponential Time: \\(O(x^n)\\) With exponential time, the number of operations increases by a constant factor whith the length of the input. An example of this is in recursion, where a function iteratively calls itself \\(n\\) times for each element of the input.\nIn the example below, I call the function twice within each call. The complexity is then a geometric series, and the closed for solution for the number of operations can be found with;\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^N ar^{i-1} = \\frac{a(1-r^{N})}{1-r} \\]\nWhere \\(r=2\\), \\(a=2\\), \\(n\\) is looped over, and we start the index at 0 (\\(i-1\\)) instead of 1, so:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=0}^n 2*2^{i} = \\frac{(1-2^{n+1})}{1-2} = \\frac{(1-2^{n+1})}{-1}=-(1-2^{n+1}) = 2^{n+1}-1 \\]\nRecursive calls generally have time complexity of \\(O(branches^{depth})\\).\ndef exponential_example(n,num_ops=0): num_ops += 1 # 1 operation per call # recursively called twice for each n\u0026gt;0 (2**n times) if n \u0026gt; 0: n-=1 num_ops += exponential_example(n) # 2**(n) num_ops += exponential_example(n) # 2**(n) return num_ops # for n in ns_to_test: out=exponential_example(n) print(\u0026#39;f({}): {}\u0026#39;.format(n,out)) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(0): 1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(1): 3 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(10): 2047 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f(20): 2097151    Data Structures Lists and Dictionaries Good descriptions of lists, dicts, and why some operations are much faster in sets or dict keys.\nIn depth description of hash tables.\n Queues and Stacks Queues and stacks are like lists that are used to prioritize operations.\n Queues are First-in-last-out structures – meaning that the highest priority is given to the least recently queued thing. Imagine people in a queue for a theme park, those who entered the queue first are prioritized for admission to the park. Stacks are Last-in-First-out structures – meaning that the highest priority is given to the most recently stacked element. Imagine a stack of books, the ones at the top of the stack are read first.   Graphs and Trees short definition with pictures\n  Sorting Lots of sort algorithms\nPython’s sotred() function uses TimSort.\nComplexity for common sorts:\n \\(O(Nlog(N))\\) for quicksort, and merge sort.  In efficient sorting algorithms, the \\(N\\) part comes from the algorithm being called on up to each element, and the \\(logN\\) part comes from binary sorting in ways that render parts of the array unnecessary later.\ne.g. ‘find median in a large dataset’ – sort half of it.\n  Searching Lots of search algorithms\nLinear Search: Binary Search Complexity \\(O(logN)\\).\ngood hackerrank video\n requires sorting before applying the search   Graph Search Graphs are a collection of nodes and edges (connections between nodes). In the code below, I use dictionaries to represent graphs – keys represent nodes, and the list of elements represents all of the nodes that the parent node is connected to.\n# examples Examples = [] # Example 1: something where DFS would do equally well? tmp_graph = {1: [2,4], 2: [3], 3: [5], 4: [5,7], 5: [6,7], 6: [], 7: []} Examples.append(tmp_graph) # Example 2: something where DFS will run faster tmp_graph = {1:[2,3,4,5],2:[6,10,8,9],3:[],4:[],5:[],6:[7],7:[],8:[],9:[],10:[]} Examples.append(tmp_graph) # Example 3: something where BFS will run faster (swapped 3 and 10) tmp_graph = {1:[2,7,4,5],2:[6,10,8,9],3:[],4:[],5:[],6:[3],7:[],8:[],9:[],10:[]} Examples.append(tmp_graph) Breadth First (BFS) and queues Breadth Frist Search (BFS) queues (FILO structures) nodes based on their distance from an origin node. This can be implemented with a list (queue) by searching the nodes at the head of the list and appending encountered nodes to the tail of the list.\n# breadth first search: just a queue def BFS_queue(graph,start,end): queue = [start] visited = set() # build and search through queue while queue: visiting = queue[0] # if this was visited already, continue if visiting in visited: continue # mark node as visited visited.add(visiting) # if this is the end, return if visiting == end: return True,visited # otherwise, append children to search queue for child in graph[visiting]: queue.append(child) queue.remove(visiting) # remove the visited node # if end was never found, return False return False,visited # breadth first search: For loop over each layer def BFS(graph,start,end): queue = [start] visited = set() # build and search through queue while queue: for visiting in queue: # if this was visited already, continue if visiting in visited: continue # mark node as visited visited.add(visiting) # if this is the end, return if visiting == end: return True,visited # otherwise, append children to search queue for child in graph[visiting]: queue.append(child) # if end was never found, return False return False,visited  Depth First (DFS) Depth First search can be implemented with recursively (below) or with a stack (LIFO structures). good hackerrank video\n Example using DFS to find if a path to a node exists.  # Depth first search with recursion def DFS(graph,start,end): visited = set() return _DFS(graph,start,end,visited),visited def _DFS(graph,start,end,visited): # if this was visited already, return False if start in visited: return False # mark node as visited visited.add(start) # if this is the target node, return True if start == end: return True # DFS through the children of this node for child in graph[start]: if _DFS(graph,child,end,visited): return True return False  DFS vs BFS  for example in Examples: print(\u0026#39;DFS path: \u0026#39;, DFS(example,1,7)) print(\u0026#39;BFSq path: \u0026#39;, BFS(example,1,7)) print(\u0026#39;BFS path: \u0026#39;, BFS(example,1,7),\u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;

FROM clause can contain a single table, or joins between tables JOINs are useful for appending tables as columns, versus ON filters the table that is returned from the JOIN – it acts similarly to the WHERE clause. WHERE clause filters the table retreived by FROM can also contain sub queries, and can perform the same filtering as ON GROUP BY groups by a single column or a set of values if given multiple columns HAVING can be used to filter groups based on an aggregation function UNION appends tables as rows   Aggregation functions The GROUP BY clause can contain GROUPING SETS, such as a ROLLUP() and CUBE() functions. These hierarchically group the rows passed to the aggregation functions. ROLLUP() hierarchically groups by arguments, starting left to right. CUBE() passes all permutations of its arguments to the aggregation functions.\nGrouping sets are described a little here.\n Window functions Orver() explained here. Some more detailed information here.\nWindow functions include OVER() and ROW_NUMBER(). They take two optional arguments, PARTITION BY and ORDER BY.\n RANK() OVER([partition_by_clause] order_by_clause): ranks the column specified in the order by clause, ties are assigned the same rank and result in skipped values DENSE_RANK() OVER([partition_by_clause] order_by_clause): ranks the column specified in the order by clause, ties are assigned the same rank, but no rank number is skipped LAG(column,lag) OVER([partition_by_clause] order_by_clause): Retreives values from a lag rows before, see example with a partition here.   Tricks:  When wanting to loop and compare, one can do a join or add a subquery and compare all columns at once.

Content:\nCurrent role background ambition and goals relevant experience methods used / skills results why you’re qualified – impressive, interesting experience key accomplishments proof of performance (not summary of job duties, unique things you did) accomplishments, competencies what you want: this position really excites me powerpoint presentation with background and results company name title number of years job responsibilities mini work snapshots for every position achievement oriented accomplishment: anything that saved time, money, profitibility, quantifyable results what you know about the role. why you are right fit: “overall … I am confident I’d be able to succeed because…” self-aware transparent (trustworthy) potential leader tell your story, one that leads clearly to their offer  My Perspective:\n What is an interviewer thinking when they ask this? They are imagining themselves working with you. Do you do cool things? Do you do relevant things? The behavioral and technical questions help to get a complete picture of what it would be like to work with you. Will you make life easier or harder, … ? Instead of making it relevant to the particular job description, make it relevnat to qualities you’d like in a colleague, and mention that explicately: “I like to dive into new things and figure them out. So during my PhD I worked on a variety of projects … .”  Example answer:\n Open: I recently graduated from UC Irvine, where I studied statistics and cognitive science. I worked on a few lines of research, the one that was most interesting to me came out of an interest in prediction markets and arbitrage. Problem: So prediction markets are a platform where people can buy and sell contracts on events that pay a dollar if the event occurs and nothing if it doesn’t occur. So for example, one market might be Who will win the 2020 election, and contracts might be ‘Bernie Sanders’, ‘Andrew Yang’, ‘Donnald Trump’, … . Since the contracts pay out $1, the theory is that the price should estimate the underlying probability of the event occuring. And since the market is aggregating information across individuals, it should be a pretty good estimate. However, individuals have shown a number of biases in probabilistic reasoning in lab studies, so I was wondering if these same biases would exist in prediction market prices. If they did, then I could make profitable trading algorithms. So I partnered with a large online prediction market to get access to their data, and found evidence of some biases consistent with those observed in lab studies. Trajectory: Overall, I realized that I enjoy these kinds of impactful analyses of real-world data, moreso than theory building through laboratory studies, so I decided to bridge into a career in data science, and joined Insight to become part of a network of data scientists.  Example Answer;\n Current role: “I’m currently a Fellow at Insight Data Science. During this, I worked on a consulting project Overall my client was really happy with my work.” Background: “Prior to Insight, I … .

Evaluation:\n Communication: Clearly explain prediction market mechanics. Enthusasism: Interest in markets and complex problems. Transferrable skills: Mention some of the models used. Value adds: Realized prediction markets are biased close to expiration – their signal is weaker than previously thought. Also able to profit literally by rolling out trading algorithms.  Child bandits: Bandit tasks are a common paradigm for studying individual level decision making and making claims about the way people make decisions. But in lots of contexts, the results you get when you addregate over trials can be different from the actual result on any trial. So I developed a model to infer on a trial by trial level, what decision making strategy kids were using to choose between two ‘bandits’ that gave out stickers. – I have an interest in using more customized models and Bayesian inference to overcome issues that arise from aggregating data at too high a level. If you had averaged over trials, then there may have been evidence for one or another model, but the dynamic changes in decision making strategies would have gone unnoticed.\n Similar approaches could be useful for dynamic experimental designs, OR in the context of Netflix, for personalization. If we could dynamically infer something like the strategy or emotional state of a user, then we could use that inference to personalize our recommended content or things like cover art or other aesthetic aspects of Netflix.    “Tell me about the project you worked on at Insight.” This question gives an opportunity to demonstrate what you’ll be capable of on Day 1.\nTemplate:\n Open: At Insight I worked on a consulting project for an external company. This company acquired users by offering a free trial, after which users would subscribe. Purpose: Goals of the project were to to 1) identify, early on, who would become a subscriber, and 2) identify how the successful users were using the product. Approach: I usually think about a generative process. Here I framed the problem as a classification problem and thought about using LDA or QDA because I thought the distributions of features would be different based on the classes. Methods: Later thought about other algorithms because this was primarily a prediction problem, and because the assumption of normally distributed features was violated. So I tried tree-based algorithms and those performed the best across all metrics – F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. Challenges: Non-normal features (could break LDA, QDA)  How could I have used a mixed effects model here? (See Maime’s blog?)\nEvaluation:\n Clarity: Relevance: Do the skills add value to the company? Logic: Were sensible solutions tried in a sensible order?   “Why are you interested in a career as a data scientist?” This is an opportunity to show that becoming a data sceientist at the company is the logical next career move, and to demonstrate that you know what to expect in the new role.\nOutline of topics that may resonate with a hiring manager:\n Skills, Technical: Tools, technologies, methods you have used. Skills, Conceptual: Your approach to understanding problems and navigating to solutions Interests: What are you eager to do in this next phase of your professional life? Interests, Broad: Knowledge of problems tackled by data professionals in this industry Interests, Specific: Knowledge of technical challenges that will be faced by someone in this role Growth, Skills: What you’re excited to learn in the next few years Growth, Trajectory: Relate this job to an ultimate career trajectory  Example answer: When I was in my PhD, I worked on a variety of projects and realized that I most enjoyed the ones that derived some impactful analysis from larger scale data – namely the prediction market project.\nEvaluation:\n Educated Enthusasiam: Professional Goals: Niche area:   “Tell me about your research / talk to me about your last role.” Same as in ‘tell me about your background..’\nEvaluation:\n Skills: Relevance: Show how previous work relates to the responsibilities of the current role. Clarity:   “Why are you interested in joining this company?” This is an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of and interest in the current role.\nDepends on deep-dive.\nEvaluation:\n Industry knowledge: Company knowledge: Potential for impact:   “Talk about a time you were on a team that struggled with effective communication.”  Situation: Where / when did this happen? What were you working on, and with whom? Task: What were you responsible for? What challenges did you face? Action: How did you decide the appropriate response to the situation? How did you implement it? Result: How do you know your solution was successful? Takeaways: What did you learn from this situation? What would you do the same or differently next time?\n Can’t think of one.. In community college I worked as a TA for my mentor, and I lead a research project which is very rare in community college settings. She was extremely supportive and I think communication and goals were clear across the team – I would make outlines / agendas for team meetings. At UC Davis, for my Bachelors, my mentor was really bad with email. But he was nice, and his office door was always open, so whenever I needed something I would stop by and chat. At Irvine people were always available via email or even phone if needed. Also I had taken a consulting class as part of the stats masters, and a portion of that emphasized the importance of clear communication with clients, so in consulting relationships I maintain clear goals and deliverables.\n  Evaluation:\n Knowledge of company values around communication: Your principles for communication: Awareness of problem: Initiative: Lessons Learned:   “Tell me about a time you made a mistake at work.”  Situation: Where/when did this happen? What were you working on, and with whom? Task: What were you responsible for? What challenges did you face? Action: How did you decide the appropriate response to the situation? How did you implement it? Result: How do you know your solution was successful? Takeaways: What did you learn from this situation? What would you do the same or differently next time?  Forgot to add code to save a questionnaire at the end of an experiment. From that point on I ran myself and analyzed my data before running any real subjects – so kind of like I learned the importance of unit tests from that experience.\nEvaluation:\n Your principles for mistakes: Knowledge of company values around rapid iteration, learning through failure, and troubleshooting Judgment: How did you explain the mistake (misunderstanding, incomplete information, technical errors)? Was it due to carelessness. Responsibility: Did you make excuses, or make solutions? Wisdom: Are you likely to avoid a similar mistake in the future? Can lessons here apply more broadly?   “Talk about a situation that required you to explain your technical work to someone outside your industry or field.” Evaluation:\n Ability to communicate with stakeholders: Impact: Understanding of what the other party needed to know Adaptability: Techniques (analogy, visualization, …) used to simply communicate ideas. How did you decide what to include. Did you clarify that the explanation made sense. Attitude: Will you patiently explain your ideas?   “Talk about a time you were asked to manage an important project.” PredictIt proejct, since that’s one that I really drove.\nEvaluation:\n Knowledge of company values on leadership Trust: Why were you chosen to lead? Respect and responsibility: Delegation: People management: Executive decision-making: Team dynamics: Potential: Strengths and weaknesses in leading. Interest in management roles:    Briefcase Document This idea also came from here.\nTemplate:\n[COMPANY NAME] Data Science Action Plan\nGoal:\nPain-Points (Speculated):\nProject #1:\nDesired Outcome\nPain Points:\n pp1  Proposed Experiment\nResource Requirements:\nAdd 3 projects as part of a deep dive.\n Thank-You Email LinkedIn Thank-You Email Recruiters Hi,\nEveryone was nice and seemed to be working on interesting things!\nBest, Mac\n First Interviewer Hi Joonhyung,\nHave you heard of Rimeto?

I also enjoyed thinking through the typical challenges that they seem to work on at Yelp.\nLet me know if you need anything from me, and I look forward to hearing back about potential next steps later this week.\nThank you, Mac\n  Cold Recruiter Email Blog on reaching out here.\n“Hey (Recruiter),\nI know you’re really busy and you get a lot of emails. Found (Company) through angellist. Already applied for the Data Scientist position but wanted to reach out directly! Promise this email will be \u0026lt; 60 seconds.\nI’m Jeff and I’m a Data Scientist. A few things about me, I built the Data Scientist in Python \u0026amp; R track for dataquest.io, used by hundreds of thousands of students and by companies such as Airbnb, Spotify, Uber etc so I excel in communicating technically complex topics to nontechnical audiences. On the technical side, I built “The Booki Monster” which is a monster that eats books and summarizes them using LDA \u0026amp; Doc2Vec. App here(it takes a sec to load, so just be patient!) and explanation here. I also built the “Date-a Miner”, a convolutional neural network that automates online dating, by predicting the likelihood of me liking a profile and swiping for me.\nIn addition, I’m obsessed with figuring out how to learn things fast. As a result, I’m also working on an ambitious side-project called Month to Master where I attempt to master one difficult skill each month. Skills such as going from zero to conversational in Spanish in one month, memorizing the order of a 52 deck of cards in 3 minutes, completing 27 consecutive pull-ups etc.\nThanks again! I totally understand if you’re busy so no rush on reply. If you feel like there is a possible fit on your end, would love to further this conversation!\nHope you have a great week! Attached resume.\nBest, Mac\u0026quot;\nEmail To RobinHood recruiter Hey Chinsin,\nI know you’re really busy and you get a lot of emails.

Convert the Status to a dictionary and access values from keys 3. Access values directly as attributes of the Status\n Embed a Status First, many the Status attributes (created_at, favorite_count, text, …) can be cleanly displayed as a tweet embedded in a notebook.

These attributes can be accessed directly from the Status object. Below I make a list of the times at which each tweet was created and check the first element of that list;\n# get list of time stamps times = [pd.Timestamp(tweet.created_at) for tweet in timeline] times.reverse() # sort s.t. times[0] is lowest, times[-1] is highest times[0] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Timestamp(\u0026#39;2018-11-01 05:56:58+0000\u0026#39;, tz=\u0026#39;tzutc()\u0026#39;) This creates a list of timestamps. By default, times from the twitter API are localized to the UTC timezone. Below I convert these to my local time in California;\ntimes = [time.tz_convert(\u0026quot;America/Los_Angeles\u0026quot;) for time in times] times[0] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Timestamp(\u0026#39;2018-10-31 22:56:58-0700\u0026#39;, tz=\u0026#39;America/Los_Angeles\u0026#39;) Now we have a list of timestamps in local time! To get a sense of the duration over which this data spans, below I compute the time difference between the frist and last timestamp;\ntimes[-1]-times[0] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Timedelta(\u0026#39;154 days 11:49:05\u0026#39;) Woah, almost 155 days of my twitter activity!\n  Poisson Process A Poisson process is a common framework for modeling events that occurr in time or space. In this context, tweets are being created over time and we are interested in modeling the rate at which tweets are created in order to predict how many tweets will be created in a week.\nAssumptions No more than one event can occur at a single point in time.  This can be violated when a user publishes a thread of multiple tweets at once. This can be fixed by recoding threads as a single status.  Independence: The interval lengths for each event are not influenced by any other event.  This can be violated if, instead of using Twitter’s thread option, a user ends a tweet with “…” to indicate that they will soon create another tweet. In this case, there are some tweets that imply a shorter interval before the next tweet.  Homogeneity: The distribution of intervals is the same throughout the entire process.  I probe this assumption in depth below, and it almost certainly violated. There are methods for modeling inhomogeneous Poisson processes, but I ignore those here.    Specification and Properties In this context tweet events are occurring across time. I index tweets with \\(i\\in\\{1,...,N\\}\\), where \\(N\\) is the total number of tweets observed. Each tweet is created at a time, \\(t_i\\), and the next tweet is observed after an interval \\(s_{i}\\). That is, if tweet \\(i\\) is created at time \\(t_{i-1}\\) then tweet \\(i+1\\) is created at time \\(t_{i}=t_{i-1}+s_{i}\\). The interval between each tweet is \\(s_i = t_{i}-t_{i-1} = (t_{i-1}+s_i)-t_{i-1}\\). The assumptions of a Poisson process permit the following distributions for three interesting features of this scenario.\nThe distribution of time between events, \\(s_i\\), is exponential; \\(s_i\\sim Expo(\\lambda) \\Rightarrow p(s_i|\\lambda) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda s_i}\\)  Here \\(\\lambda\\) is a parameter that describes the tweet rate.  Given an interval of length \\(s\\), the distribution of the count of events in that interval, \\(c|s\\), is Poisson; \\(c|s\\sim Poisson(\\lambda s) \\Rightarrow p(c|s,\\lambda) = \\frac{(\\lambda s)^{c}e^{-\\lambda s}}{c!}\\)  The count of events, \\(c\\), in a fixed interval depends both on the rate of the events, \\(\\lambda\\), and the duration of the interval, \\(s\\).  The distribution of the total interval required for \\(c\\) events, \\(s|c\\), is gamma; \\(s|c \\sim Gamma(c,\\lambda) \\Rightarrow p(s|c,\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^c}{\\Gamma(c)}(s)^{c-1}e^{-\\lambda s}\\)  The interval, \\(s\\), required for a fixed number of events depends on both the rate of the events, \\(\\lambda\\), and the number of events, \\(c\\).   More information on these three kinds of distributions, and ways to implement them in Python, can be found in the scipy documentation on statistical functions. General information on each of these distributions can be found on the Wikipedia page for the exponential, Poisson, or gamma distribution. A key difference between the standard uses of these distributions and their roles in a Poisson process is that the rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is also scaled by the duration of an interval \\(s\\) when constructing a distribution for the count of events in interval \\(s\\) (2, above) or the duration of the interval required for \\(c\\) events (3, above).\n Checking the Homogeneity Assumption The homogeneity assumption strictly requires that tweet rates are constant across time. This would generate data that are uniform across meaningful intervals such as time in a week or time in a day. To check homogeneity, below I convert the timestamps into the hour within a week, minute within a day, and minute within an hour, and plot tweet counts across these representations of time.\n# convert to hours in a week hour_of_week = [t.weekday()*24+t.hour+t.minute/60 for t in times] minute_of_day = [t.hour*60+t.minute+t.second/60 for t in times] minute_of_hour = [t.minute+t.second/60 for t in times] plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)); plt.hist(hour_of_week,bins=80); plt.title(\u0026quot;My Tweet Counts By Hour Of Week\u0026quot;); plt.ylabel(\u0026quot;Count\u0026quot;); plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;Hour In Week\u0026quot;); The histogram above indicates that there might be some hours of the week that have a higher rate than others. For example, I don’t seem to tweet much early on Sunday (hours 0-5), but I do seem to tweet a lot during the day on Sunday (around hours 6-20). Below I use rug plots, which represent a tweet event with a vertical line near the x-axis, and an imposed kernel density estimate, which is a continuous version of a histogram. I remake this plot in terms of hours within a week, minutes within a day, and minutes within an hour. If the tweet rate (\\(\\lambda\\)) were homogeneous, then the kernel density estimate would be approximately flat.\ndef rug_plot_and_density(dat,bw,xlab,xlim): # rug plot + density plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) sns.distplot(dat, hist = False, kde = True, rug = True, color = \u0026#39;darkblue\u0026#39;, kde_kws={\u0026#39;linewidth\u0026#39;: 3,\u0026quot;bw\u0026quot;:bw}, rug_kws={\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;}) # formatting plt.title(\u0026#39;Tweet Density By \u0026#39;+xlab) plt.xlabel(xlab) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Kernel Density\u0026#39;) plt.xlim(xlim); plt.show() # data and plot formatting arguments dats = (hour_of_week,minute_of_day,minute_of_hour) xlabs=(\u0026#39;Hour of Week\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Minute of Day\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Minute of Hour\u0026#39;) xlims=([0,24*7],[0,24*60],[0,60]); bws = (4,40,4) # make plots for dat,xlab,xlim,bw in zip(dats,xlabs,xlims,bws): rug_plot_and_density(dat=dat,bw=bw,xlab=xlab,xlim=xlim) Are very sensitive to the choice of the bandwidth parameter that determines the window over which to aggregate events (similar to bin size when using a histogram). I’m using these plots to demonstrate possible violations of homogeneity that I would follow up on in a real analysis, but will not follow up on here.\nFrom the top plot, there seems to be two patterns. First, a series of peaks and troughs that roughly correspond to daytime and night-time hours. I probably tweet with a higher frequency when I am awake, rather than asleep – meaning that \\(\\lambda\\) may depend on time within a day. Second, a generally lower kernel density estimate during the middle than the edges. I may tweet more during the weekends (edge hours) than week days (middle hours).\nFrom the middle plot that displays tweet frequencies by minutes within a day, there again seem to be two trends. First, I rarely tweet before minute 400 (around 6:40AM). Second, I have peaks around minute 600 (10:00AM), 1000 (4:40PM), and 1350 (10:00PM). This might be related to the times that I take a break from working. I generally take a break around 5:00PM, and usually take another break before bed around 9:00-10:00PM.\nThe bottom plot displays tweet frequencies by minutes within an hour. This seems more flat overall longer periods of time, but I may strangely tend to tweet more during the first half of hours.\nOverall, there are many reasons that the homogeneity assumption may be violated. For cases like this, the tweet rate \\(\\lambda\\) can be modeled as a function of time. However, to keep this example simple, I’ll ignore possible violations and proceede as if \\(\\lambda\\) were a constant with respect to time.\n Checking the exponential distribution of intervals Let’s the distribution of the time between tweets, \\(s_i\\). If the assumptions of the Poisson process were satisfied, then the intervals between tweets would follow an exponential distribution. Below I compute the number of seconds between tweets and display each value as a black dash on the x-axis. I overlay a histogram, a kernel density, and a exponential density based on the observed mean interval.\n# compute intervals between tweets ss = [times[i]-times[i-1] for i in range(1,len(times))]; # convert from Timedelta to total time in seconds ss = [si.total_seconds() for si in ss] # histogram and density plot plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) sns.distplot(ss, hist = True, kde = True, rug = True, color = \u0026#39;darkblue\u0026#39;, bins=100, hist_kws={\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;:[0,.7,.5,.5],\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;Histogram\u0026#39;}, kde_kws={\u0026#39;linewidth\u0026#39;: 3,\u0026quot;bw\u0026quot;:60*60,\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;Kernel Density\u0026#39;}, rug_kws={\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;}) plt.xlim([0,680000]); plt.title(\u0026#39;Distribution of intervals between tweets\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;Seconds\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Frequency\u0026#39;) # overlay an exponential density tmp_rate=np.mean(ss) tmpx = np.linspace(0,680000,680000*5) tmpy = expon.pdf(tmpx,scale=tmp_rate) plt.plot(tmpx,tmpy,color=[.7,0,0,1],linewidth=3,label=\u0026#39;Exponential Density\u0026#39;); # add legend plt.legend(); Based on the relative heights of the kernel density and the exponential density, there seem to be more short intervals, fewer moderate length intervals, and more long intervals relative to the exponential distribution. The mean and standard deviation of an exponential distribution should be the same value. Below I check the standard deviaion and mean of the observed intervals.\n# check standard deviation np.std(ss),np.mean(ss),np.std(ss)/np.mean(ss) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; (90150.9122414953, 67076.1055276382, 1.3440093388300445) The observed standard deviation is about 1.34 times larger (variance is about 1.80 times larger) than it would be if the data were exponentially distributed with the observed mean. While this could be accounted for with an overdispersion parameter, I will ignore this issue here for the sake of having a simple and fast online model.\n  Model of Tweet Fequency Using Conjugacy First, I’ll assume (despite the overdispersion) that the intervals between tweets follow an exponential distribution;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} s_i|\\lambda \u0026amp;\\sim Expo(\\lambda) \\\\ \\Rightarrow p(s_i|\\lambda) \u0026amp;= \\lambda e^{-s_i \\lambda} \\end{aligned} \\]\nTo account for uncertainty in \\(\\lambda\\), I’ll use a Gamma distribution with shape \\(\\alpha\\) and rate \\(\\beta\\);\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\lambda \u0026amp;\\sim Gamma(\\alpha,\\beta) \\\\ \\Rightarrow p(\\lambda|\\alpha,\\beta) \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\lambda^{\\alpha-1}e^{-\\lambda \\beta} \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe choice of a Gamma distribution allows for fast updates using conjugacy between the prior beliefs about \\(\\lambda\\) based on data observed up to time \\(t\\) and the exponential likelihood for the interval observed at time \\(t\\);\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\lambda | s_t \u0026amp;\\sim Gamma(\\alpha_t,\\beta_t) \\\\ p(s_{t+1}|\\lambda) \u0026amp;= \\lambda e^{-s_{t+1} \\lambda} \\\\ p(\\lambda|\\alpha_t,\\beta_t,s_{t+1}) \u0026amp;\\propto p(s_{t+1}|\\lambda) p(\\lambda|\\alpha_t,\\beta_t) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\lambda e^{-s_{t+1} \\lambda} \\frac{\\beta_t^{\\alpha_t}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_t)} \\lambda^{\\alpha_t-1}e^{-\\lambda \\beta_t} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\lambda^{\\alpha_t} e^{-\\lambda(s_{t+1}+\\beta_t)} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\lambda | s_{t+1} \u0026amp;\\sim Gamma(\\alpha_t+1,\\beta_t+s_{t+1}) \\end{aligned} \\]\nThis implies the following update rules for computing the parameters of the posterior over \\(\\lambda\\);\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\alpha_{t+1} \u0026amp;\\leftarrow \\alpha_t +1 \\\\ \\beta_{t+1} \u0026amp;\\leftarrow \\beta_t + s_{t+1} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nTo answer the question of how many tweets might be observed in a period of time, I’ll assume that the count of tweets \\(c\\) is Poisson distributed with rate \\(\\lambda\\). Then the number of tweets expected in an interval of length \\(s\\) would be;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\theta \u0026amp;= s\\lambda \\\\ c|\\theta \u0026amp;\\sim Poisson(\\theta) \\\\ \\Rightarrow p(c|\\theta) \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\theta^c e^{-\\theta}}{c!} \\end{aligned} \\]\nThis means that, rather than \\(\\lambda\\), we are actually interested in the distribution of \\(\\theta=s\\lambda\\). I derive this below using a change of vairables;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\theta = s\\lambda \u0026amp;\\Rightarrow \\lambda = \\frac{\\theta}{s} = \\theta s^{-1} \\\\ p_\\theta(\\theta | \\lambda,s) \u0026amp;= p_\\lambda\\left(\\theta s^{-1} | s,\\alpha,\\beta\\right) \\left| \\frac{d \\lambda}{d \\theta}\\right|\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{s}\\right)^{\\alpha-1}e^{-\\frac{\\theta}{s}\\beta} \\left|s^{-1}\\right| \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\theta^{(\\alpha-1)}s^{-({\\alpha-1})-1}e^{-\\frac{\\theta}{s}\\beta} \\\\ \\Rightarrow p(\\theta|s,\\alpha,\\beta)\u0026amp;= \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{s}\\right)^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\theta^{(\\alpha-1)}e^{-\\theta\\frac{\\beta}{s}}\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nNow we can find the distribution of \\(c\\) that accounts for uncertainty in \\(\\theta\\) through the prior on \\(\\lambda\\);\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} p(c|s,\\alpha,\\beta) \u0026amp;= \\int_\\theta p(c|\\theta)p(\\theta|s,\\alpha,\\beta)d\\theta \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\int_\\theta \\frac{\\theta^c e^{-\\theta}}{c!} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{s}\\right)^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\theta^{(\\alpha-1)}e^{-\\theta\\frac{\\beta}{s}} d\\theta \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{s}\\right)^\\alpha}{c!\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\int_\\theta \\theta^c e^{-\\theta} \\theta^{(\\alpha-1)}e^{-\\theta\\frac{\\beta}{s}} d\\theta \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{s}\\right)^\\alpha}{c!\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\int_\\theta \\theta^{c+\\alpha-1} e^{-\\theta\\left(\\frac{\\beta+s}{s}\\right)} d\\theta \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{s}\\right)^\\alpha}{c!\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\frac{\\Gamma(c+\\alpha)}{\\left(\\frac{\\beta+s}{s}\\right)^{c+\\alpha}} \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\Gamma(c+\\alpha)}{c!\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\beta^\\alpha s^{-\\alpha} s^{c+\\alpha} (\\beta+s)^{-(c+\\alpha)} \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\Gamma(c+\\alpha)}{\\Gamma(c+1)\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\left(\\frac{s}{\\beta+s}\\right)^c \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+s}\\right)^\\alpha \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nSince a Poisson Process assumes that no more than one event can occur in an interval, intervals can be treated as discrete Bernoulli trials in which an event either occurs or does not occur. In this discrete settng, the distribution of the count of intervals with an event \\(k\\) for a given number of intervals without the event \\(r\\) and a probability of the event in each interval \\(p\\) will follow a negative binomial distribution;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} k \u0026amp;\\sim NegBino(r,p) \\\\ \\Rightarrow p(k|r,p) \u0026amp;= \\frac{(k+r-1)!}{r! (k-1)!}p^{k}(1-p)^{r} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\Gamma(k+r)}{\\Gamma(r+1) \\Gamma(k)}p^{k}(1-p)^{r} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nCombining the two results above, we see that the count \\(c\\) in an interval \\(s\\) will follow a negative binomial distribution such that \\(\\alpha\\) fixes the number of intervals in which no event occurs, and \\(\\frac{s}{\\beta+s}\\) captures the probability of an event in any unit length interval;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} c \u0026amp;\\sim NegBino\\left(\\alpha,\\frac{s}{\\beta+s}\\right) \\\\ \\Rightarrow p(c|s,\\alpha,\\beta) \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\Gamma(c+\\alpha)}{\\Gamma(c+1)\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\left(\\frac{s}{\\beta+s}\\right)^c \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+s}\\right)^\\alpha \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nIn summary, the key components of this model are the exponential likelihood and gamma priors which allow for the fast and simple updating rules to compute the posterior over \\(\\lambda\\), and the negative binomial predictive distribution which accounts for the uncertainty in \\(\\lambda\\). So the applicable information from above is;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\lambda \u0026amp;\\sim Gamma(\\alpha_t,\\beta_t) \\\\ s_{t+1} \u0026amp;\\sim Expo(\\lambda) \\\\ \\alpha_{t+1} \u0026amp;\\leftarrow \\alpha_t + 1 \\\\ \\beta_{t+1} \u0026amp;\\leftarrow \\beta_t + s_{t+1} \\\\ c|s,\\alpha,\\beta \u0026amp;\\sim NegBino\\left(\\alpha,\\frac{s}{\\beta+s}\\right) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nHere I investigate posterior predictive intervals for tweets over a period of time \\(s\\) while using different components of this model. In the code below, I compute all values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) based on the update rules derived above from conjugacy.\n# initialize alpha,beta as 0 alpha,beta = 0,0 alphas,betas = list(),list() # for each observed interval in ss, for si in ss: si = si/(60*60*24) # si s/1 * 1/60 m/s * 1/60 h/m * 1/24 d/h convert to days alpha+=1 # increment alpha by 1 beta+=si # increment beta by the interval length # save parameters for analysis alphas.append(alpha) betas.append(beta) The code above converts intervals from seconds to days and comptutes \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) for all intervals in my dataset. This gives the parameters for posterior beliefs over \\(\\lambda\\) as each tweet is observed. Below I check the final parameters and some statistics from the last posterior.\na,b,mode,median,mean=(alpha,beta,(alpha-1)/beta,gamma.ppf(.5,a=alpha,scale=1/beta),alpha/beta) print( \u0026#39;alpha : \u0026#39;+str(a)+ \u0026#39;\\nbeta : \u0026#39;+str(b)+ \u0026#39;\\nmode : \u0026#39;+str(mode)+ \u0026#39;\\nmedian: \u0026#39;+str(median)+ \u0026#39;\\nmean : \u0026#39;+str(mean)) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; alpha : 199 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; beta : 154.49241898148153 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; mode : 1.2816162845099446 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; median: 1.2859321345366828 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; mean : 1.2880890940276715 The value of \\(\\alpha\\) correctly indicates 199 observed intervals, and the \\(\\beta\\) of 154.59 also correctly reflects the time difference in days that was computed in the first section. Lastly the ordinal relationship of the mode, median, and mean is consistent with that of a gamma distribution.\nInference On Tweet Rate \\(\\lambda\\) Over Time In the code below, I compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, or posterior mode, across time. I plot this across time with the 97.5\\(^{th}\\) and 2.5\\(^{th}\\) percentiles as a shaded region representing the 95% credible interval.\n# get MAP lambda lambda_map = [(alpha-1)/beta for alpha,beta in zip(alphas,betas)] # get CI upper and lower bounds lambda_upper = [gamma.ppf(.975,a=alpha,scale=1/beta) for alpha,beta in zip(alphas,betas)] lambda_lower = [gamma.ppf(.025,a=alpha,scale=1/beta) for alpha,beta in zip(alphas,betas)] # plot over time plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) sns.distplot(times[1:], hist = False, kde = False, rug = True, color = \u0026#39;darkblue\u0026#39;, rug_kws={\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;}); plt.plot(times[1:],lambda_map,color=[0,0,1],label=\u0026#39;MAP\u0026#39;); plt.fill_between(times[1:], lambda_lower, lambda_upper,color=[0,0,1,.1],label=\u0026#39;95% CI\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Posterior on Lambda (tweets/day)\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;Time\u0026#39;) plt.title(\u0026#39;Summary of the posterior over $\\lambda$ across time\u0026#39;) plt.legend(); The posterior seems to tighten dramatically around the mode during the first month, and the mode seems to stabalize after about that much time. However, this method seems slow to adjust to the slower rate of tweets in 2019. One way to address this might be to add weights to the parameter updates such that \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are more sensitive to recent data than past data. These weights (or stepsize or learning rates) can be based on the surprisal, or likelihood, of a new tweet under the posterior. If the new interval was well anticipated, then little updating is needed, but if the new interval was very surprising or unlikely, then a sharpe change in \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) might be warrented.\n  Predicting Number Of Tweets In Interval \\(s\\) Now I’ll visually compare predictions for the count of tweets in a week based on estimates of \\(\\lambda\\) after the first 20 tweets and using all 200 tweets, using two models;\nA Poisson using \\(\\theta=s\\lambda_{MAP}\\) The negative binomial derived in the model section above  First, an issue with the parameterization of the negative binomial has to be addressed. In my derivation, I ended with a negative binomial parameterized as;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} k\u0026amp;:\\text{Number of successes} \\\\ r\u0026amp;:\\text{Number of failures} \\\\ p\u0026amp;:\\text{Probability of failure} \\\\ p(k|r,p) \u0026amp;= \\frac{(k+r-1)!}{r! (k-1)!}p^{k}(1-p)^{r} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe Scipy.stats.nbinom function defines a negative binomial with;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} k\u0026amp;:\\text{Number of failures} \\\\ n\u0026amp;:\\text{Number of successes} \\\\ p\u0026amp;:\\text{Probability of success} \\\\ p(k|n,p) \u0026amp;= \\frac{(k+n-1)!}{(n-1)!k!} p^{n}(1-p)^{k} \\end{aligned} \\]\nRecall in my derivation that the parameter corresponding to probability of failure was \\(p=\\frac{s}{\\beta+s}\\). The differences in parameterization can be accounted for by supplying the nbinom function with \\(p=1-\\frac{s}{\\beta+s}=\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+s}\\).\nThe code below plots predictive densities based on the two approaches above from estimates of \\(\\lambda\\) based only on the first 20 observations.\n# for the first 20 tweets # parameters cs = range(20) s = 7 index = 19 theta = s*lambda_map[index] plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) # plot the Poisson density plt.scatter(cs,poisson.pmf(cs,theta)) plt.plot( cs,poisson.pmf(cs,theta),label=\u0026#39;Poisson\u0026#39;) # plot the negative binomial density plt.scatter(cs,nbinom.pmf(cs,n=alphas[index],p=betas[index]/(s+betas[index]))) plt.plot( cs,nbinom.pmf(cs,n=alphas[index],p=betas[index]/(s+betas[index])),label=\u0026#39;Negative Binomial\u0026#39;); # labels plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Mass\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;Count\u0026#39;) plt.title(\u0026#39;Predictions for Tweet Counts in a Week, Using 20 Observations\u0026#39;) plt.legend(); With a small amount of data, the uncertainty in the estimate of tweet rates carries through the negative binomial model, which gives more mass to a wider range of counts relative to the Poisson model that discards uncertainty when by \\(\\lambda_{MAP}\\).\n# Using all data # parameters index = 198 theta = s*lambda_map[index] plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) # plot the Poisson density plt.scatter(cs,poisson.pmf(cs,theta)) plt.plot( cs,poisson.pmf(cs,theta),label=\u0026#39;Poisson\u0026#39;) # plot the negative binomial density plt.scatter(cs,nbinom.pmf(cs,n=alphas[index],p=betas[index]/(s+betas[index]))) plt.plot( cs,nbinom.pmf(cs,n=alphas[index],p=betas[index]/(s+betas[index])),label=\u0026#39;Negative Binomial\u0026#39;); # labels plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Mass\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;Count\u0026#39;) plt.title(\u0026#39;Predictions for Tweet Counts in a Week, Using All Data\u0026#39;) plt.legend(); With a larger amount of data and predicting the tweet count over a short interval (7 days), the predictive distribution from the negative binomial and Poisson models are nearly indistinguishable.

Given Status objects, I then showed how to embed them in a notebook, view them as a dictionary, and otherwise access their attributes to construct a list of tweet timestamps. I then described Poisson Processes as they may apply to modeling user tweet rates and tweet counts over periods of time. I used kernel densities to check assumptions of a Poisson Process and found possible violations of homogeneity, and of the result that intervals between tweets should follow an exponential distribution.\nPunting these violations, I developed a model of tweet frequency using conjugacy between Gamma priors and Exponential likelihoods. To predict tweet counts over a period of time, I derived a negative binomial predictive distribution that accounted for uncertainty in a user’s tweet rate. I compared this distribution to a Poisson distribution that ignored uncertainty by taking only the maximum a posteriori estimate of a user’s tweet rate.\nOverall the model that discards posterior uncertainty attributes less mass to fringe counts, especially when there is little data or when the interval over which counts are being predicted is long. Incorporating posterior uncertainty broadens the predictive distribution to reflect uncertainty in the underlying tweet rate. That uncertainty exists regardless of the modeling approach – excluding it from predictive distributions only leads to narrow, overconfident predictions. This general principle of propagating uncertainty through a statistical process is one strong advantage of the Bayeian modeling approach that I developed and applied here.\n ","date":1566071763,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566071763,"objectID":"0b4907df5df827ce35a063ba893b6eb6","permalink":"/MacStrelioff/data-science/twitter-poisson-processes-and-conjugacy/","publishdate":"2019-08-17T19:56:03Z","relpermalink":"/MacStrelioff/data-science/twitter-poisson-processes-and-conjugacy/","section":"data-science","summary":"Background and Setup Twitter Data Pulling Data from Twitter’s API Working with Twitter Status objects Embed a Status Convert a Status to a dict Access Status Attributes (How I accessed the data used below)  Poisson Process Assumptions Specification and Properties Checking the Homogeneity Assumption Checking the exponential distribution of intervals  Model of Tweet Fequency Using Conjugacy Inference On Tweet Rate \\(\\lambda\\) Over Time  Predicting Number Of Tweets In Interval \\(s\\) Summary   Background and Setup In this notebook I focus on explaining Poisson processes and conjugacy applied to my Twitter activity.","tags":null,"title":"Twitter, Poisson Processes, and Conjugacy","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Company Visit Chris info –  Recruiter Call Recruiter emails II \u0026amp; III – Interviews Schedule and interviewers: 10:00-10:45 | Host Leader | Joonhyung Lim 10:45-11:30 | Statistical Modeling | Dongping (sunny) Jing and Caitlin Crump: 11:30-12:30 | Lunch | Nuo Wang 12:30-1:15 | Data Manipulation | Xianyun Mao: 1:15-2:00 | Statistics \u0026amp; A/B Testing | | Qiannan Yin and Yuan Chai: 2:00-2:45 | Analytics Case Study | Gigi Zhang: Users Current issues Ideas and excitement Excitement from Recruiter  Onsite Glassdoor interview questions   Knowledge gaps Next steps   Company Visit Chris info –  DS people generally get interviewed on computer engineering topics – eg implementing data structures from scratch, … Interview centrally for AI organization, then get matched with a team.

My family is mainly construction workers and mechanics, which is a demographic that LinkedIn could expand to.. Construction – work with unions to find employment for qualified workers, and with contractors to find jobs. More generally, LinkedIn could create a marketplace for union workers and contractors. Amazon has mturk for very low-skill tasks, LinkedIn could create a marketplace for higher skill gigs, freelance work, temp work, and contract work.\n Areas for growth: Services: resume drafting, job description drafting, HR system software for industry (could link it with corporate Office products) and get more data about the probability of an applicant attaining an offer.\n History: PredictIt project, strategy inference, decision making Job Search: Generally like experimentation roles. I was first interested in LinkedIn because the anti-abuse team sounded awesome. I also liked the demo experience, there was a big turn out, and people seemed engaged. But overall the most exciting thing to me has been how company culture manifests in things like InDay, where individual across the company take time to give back to the community. I also really like the value that LinkedIn adds, and the direction LinkedIn seems to be going in, in terms of identifying the skills a person can learn to advance their career and advertising helpful resources to them. Thinking about my own journey through academia and now into data science, I spent a lot of time browsing Coursera, YouTube, and various online resources – I can imagine LinkedIn learning becoming a streamlined product for independent lerarning that basically syncs with your professional LinkedIn profile. I like the idea to engage high school students, and opening access to knowledge of hiring practices, career trajectories, and salary ranges. I come from a family of construction workers, so I was very much a black swan while figuring out how to navigate through community college, undergraduate school, and graduate school, and now into a technical career. I grew up in ‘blue collar’ world, and broke into the academic world, and now I’m jumping into ‘white collar’ technical industry world. This was really hard, and required a lot of self-learning and building professional relationships – so I very much understand the value that LinkedIn can add for people like me. So yeah I can see LinkedIn as something that moderates the education market, and the labor market – and based on my experiences navigating these things mostly on my own, I’d be really interested in contributing to products that democratize education and professional connections. Also really interested in the almost academic work that has come out of LinkedIn – I found papers on inferring user attributes, which is a very similar problem to one of my favorite projects in grad school. For that project I (kid gambling, strategy inference project). Also interested in the economics work (see others in ‘excitement’ section below) Overall, exciting work and a culture / mission / potential that resonates with me.

Each time you can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. In addition, he asks some question about my research such as graph algorithms. I had 3 phone interviews with Linkedin data scientists. Everyone I spoke to was very bright, thoughtful and polite and made a great impression. On the first two calls I was asked how I would solve some of the problems Linkedin worked on (ex: people you may know) and on the third call I had a more technical coding interview. However I didn’t have a machine learning background at the time, so they did not give me an offer but encouraged me to e-apply after I had taken some of the machine learning classes I was planning to take the next semester. Considering how little machine learning I knew at the time it’s a wonder they even gave me a first interview, let alone 3. There is a significant increase in linkedin signups in this month. How much of this will you attribute to the changes you made in signup process. What data-points would you look into to confirm/deny this?\n Implement pow function.

The second interview was almost identical, except that the question was more about algorithm design, which required general problem solving skill. I don’t recall exactly, but they asked about how I would approach several scenarios. This would be very difficult to answer well if you have not worked at a similar company and know what sorts of data are available to answer the question.\n basic data mining questions, including the concepts of classification and clustering; and a simple dp question which is quite similar to “Climbing Stairs”, and failed the second one right after I came back from another state (basic nlp questions, like named entity extraction, and basic data mining questions, like SVM, naive bayes; and a sampling question which is quite similar to Reservoir sampling).\n The first interview was to test my SQL/R coding skills. The second interview was around experimenation - A/B testing, metrics etc., The third interview was on a bit of probability, machine learning techniques . The final one was with director of data science on a case study related to some linkedin scenarios and overall career interests. Even though all the interviews were set-up without any delay, what surprised me is that I didn’t receive any response from the HR after all the interviews. I followed up for a month or so multiple times, but I received absolutely no response, which I have no clue why. Questions around current / previous experience and education. Important metrics to think of in relation to LinkedIn data, to be included in dashboards available to executive level. Questions around SQL, R, and Python.\n     Knowledge gaps  Lots of questions about the platform Causal inference: how to construct a synthetic control, e.g. for estimating from historical data the impact of a email nudge on different user behaviors Advantages / disadvantages of different ML models (why logistic regression?

Be prepared to discuss your past work involving analyzing large and complicated datasets, defending your approaches and communicating what you learned during your project. You have a good chance of getting a product metrics or experimentation question based on some actual questions Yelp is tackling at the moment.\nIf you have time before the interview, check out Yelp’s engineering and data blogs and see if anything’s relevant. Be familiar with A/B testing and brush up on your Python (Yelpers love Python) and/or R abilities to be ready for a live data analysis problem.\nAnd finally, of course, follow the general interview advice: elaborate on related projects from your resume, be enthusiastic, share your thoughts with your interviewer as you’re going through a problem or doing a piece of analysis, and be sure to ask questions for clarification!\nThe team will also focus on why you want to be a part of the Yelp team! – look into Metrics Fact sheet and Culture\nDiscussion of past work “Be prepared to discuss your past work involving analyzing large and complicated datasets, defending your approaches and communicating what you learned during your project.”\n“elaborate on related projects from your resume”\nPredictIt Project:\n Situation: Project: Maybe sketch the fig of price for Trump win versus Republican win I also aggregated data based on days until expiration, and applied a linear in log odds model at each day. Found the common S shaped calibration curve that comes up in lab experiments, particularly at 1-2 days before market expiration. Result: Value to Yelp: Relates to the economic patterns maybe?  Strategy Inference Project:\n Situation: Project: Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions. I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time. Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time. Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user’s decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings. More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings.  General interest in decision making:\n Situation: Models of multi-alternative decision making are often applied to food preferences to see how people integrate information about price, healthyness, flavor, … . Excitement: Yelp is basically a giant experiment in multiattribute decision making. Value to Yelp: Theoretical insights might help in guiding how restaurant informaiton is displayed to consumers.  Insight Project:\n User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features   Product metrics or experimentation “You have a good chance of getting a product metrics or experimentation question based on some actual questions Yelp is tackling at the moment.”\n General questions:  One of Yelp’s values is Tenaciousness – can you give some examples of how that manefists on a data science team?     Deep Dive Stakeholders and Use Cases  Consumers: Use Yelp as a recommendation engine based on crown-sourced reviews, and as a platform for expression through reviews Businesses: Use Yelp to gain clients   User Flows and Metrics Thinking of the broader user flow can help with identifying measurable events within that flow (metrics). Overall, consider units of individuals (accounts, unique visitors, cookies, IPs…), units of time (daily, weekly), and referents (week over week, …)\n good source for some key metrics  On Web Users (IPs) arrive on Yelp, can be assigned a cookie, or associated with an account if the user creates one.   Growth: DAU, MAU Growth: monthly new users, monthly unique users Engagement: Reviews per user per month Engagement: Engagement: Traffic to business pages Monetization: Reservations Monetization: Waitlist\n Performance: Wait times at restaurants Some metrics for business partners\n   On Mobile     Current issues  Trust, businesses can game Yelp by asking for low ratings, Trust, Businesses accuse Yelp of maliciously manipulating reviews, to such an extent that, in response to a documentary about this, Yelp redirected BillionDollerBully.com to this response. Influence: “Such ubiquity has consequences. A study from last year found that a measly half-star difference made it 19% more likely that a San Francisco restaurant would be busy at peak times.” - this post Lack of expected growth: “He cited a lack of growth from several of the site’s advertising efforts for his downgrade, as well as a lack of “consequential” new products “to reduce churn or drive revenue.” this post Balancing review usefulness, reliability, and legitimacy -   Competitors  “On one extreme, Angie’s List features reviews of local products and services provided by and visible to its fee-paying members. On the other, Urbanspoon and CitySearch, Tripadvisor, and Amazon don’t really scrutinize reviewers or reviews.” - this post Full paragraph: “For better and for worse, strangers’ opinions affect our purchasing behavior to an unprecedented degree. Such feedback, of course, is easily corrupted. Websites like Yelp face the problem of whether and how to scrutinize the data they receive to ensure reliability. On one extreme, Angie’s List features reviews of local products and services provided by and visible to its fee-paying members. On the other, Urbanspoon and CitySearch, Tripadvisor, and Amazon don’t really scrutinize reviewers or reviews. While more democratic, they’re also much more susceptible to manipulation and therefore theoretically less useful to consumers. If a business owner or her friend or someone she pays can pose as a happy customer — or sabotage her competition — a review is no more useful than an ad.”   Ideas, excitement, questions to ask Ideas:\n I like that they have data challenges I like their openness with data, particularly the datasets on Kaggle  Excitement:\n Chek relationship between restaurant response time to critical reviews, and other restaurant demand metrics like reservations or ratings. check for predictive relationship between reservations or delivery orders made in a quarter, and a conglomerate’s or restaurant’s revenue for that quarter?

The game Cookie Clicker is a great testing ground for such algorithms. The game is played by clicking a big cooke to earn money (cookies) that can be used to invest in instruments (buy buildings), which in turn generate revenue (more cookies). Here I’ll describe three agents that I made for this game and assess their performance. I also describe many of the helper functions involved in implementing these agents. The code that implements these agents and reproduces all figures in this blog post can be found on my GitHub, here: https://github.com/MacStrelioff/CookieClickerAgent\n Background and Setup Cookie Clicker Game The interface for Cookie Clicker is shown below.\n The goal of the game is to amass wealth in the form of cookies. Your balance and revenue are shown above the large cookie. Cookies are earned each time you click the large cookie and investments, shown at the bottom right, are unlocked as you acquire wealth. Purchasing an investment (Cursor, Grandma, …) provides recurring revenue in cookies per second. For any specific investment, the price of the next investment increases each time the investment is purchased. In developing the algorithms below I focused on maximizing revenue, which would maximize wealth over time.\nThe game has other mechanics (upgrades, ascension, golden cookies, …). I programed functions to purchase upgrades and click golden cookies, but these functions were disabled in the analyses below to allow for a controlled comparison of the agents.\n  Agents While the goal was to earn as many cookies as possible, the game also allows revenue to accrue while the player is away, and the amount of cookies earned per click can scale with revenue. For these reasons, I focused on maximizing revenue as the overall goal for any strategy.\nNaive: Buy all affordable investments The simplest investment strategy was to purchase any affordable building. This is implemented in the code below:\nclass agent_class_naive: ... def buy_products(self): products = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) while products: # if there are affordable products, buy them products[-1].click() products = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) ... Here products is a list of the web elements that represent the affordable buildings, and the while loop cycles over them, buying the most expensive ones first with products[-1].click(), until no more buildings are affordable. This purchasing logic is implemented through a buy_products method of the naive agent, agent_class_naive. In my code, the naive agent class also contained the necessary helper functions, described in the section above.\n MaxROI: Buy best return on investment The second strategy is to buy the option that will have the best return on investment (revenue to price ratio). The code below extends the naive agent, agent_class_naive, by overriding the buy_products method that implements the investment strategy.\nclass agent_class_max_rps_price_ratio(agent_class_naive): # overwrite the buy_products method def buy_products(self): ## update building info self.get_building_info() # while best is affordable, buy the best rps/price building best_building_affordable = True while best_building_affordable: ## get unlocked products products = (driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) + driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked disabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)) # find max rps/price building max_rps_pp,building_to_buy,product_to_buy = 0,[],[] for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): # get rps/price for building cur_rps_pp = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps/price\u0026#39;] # if it\u0026#39;s the best so far, update max and building id if cur_rps_pp \u0026gt; max_rps_pp: max_rps_pp,building_to_buy = cur_rps_pp,building product_to_buy = products[i] # store element to click # update balance self.log_balance_and_revenue() # check if best building is affordable. if self.building_info[building_to_buy][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]\u0026lt;=self.balance: # buy building_to_buy (click on this product) product_to_buy.click() # update building info (including rps per price rps_pp) self.get_building_info() else: best_building_affordable=False # if not affordable, break the loop  First the MaxROI agent updates building information, including; cookies per second, price, and the ratio cps/price, using the helper method get_building_info(). Then it purchases the buildings that provide the max ROI, until the best building by this metric is unaffordable. The search for the best building is implemented in the section:\n# find max rps/price building max_rps_pp,building_to_buy,product_to_buy = 0,[],[] for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): # get rps/price for building cur_rps_pp = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps/price\u0026#39;] # if it\u0026#39;s the best so far, update max and building id if cur_rps_pp \u0026gt; max_rps_pp: max_rps_pp,building_to_buy = cur_rps_pp,building product_to_buy = products[i] # store element to click This is an \\(O(N)\\) search through the buildings that have information, where \\(N\\) is the number of buildings. This code logs the maximum ROI in max_rps_pp and the building associated with this ROI in building_to_buy, as well as the web element to click in order to purchase this building, product_to_buy. After the best ROI investment is found, the next few lines of code update the agent’s balance and check if the investment is affordable. If it is, the agent buys it and this process repeats, if it is not then best_building_affordable is set to False which ends the while loop.\n MinWait: Buy what minimizes the time to the highest revenue purchase The intuition of this strategy is to buy the investment that maximizes revenue, however, those investments can be expensive. Other investments may increase revenue enough to decrease the amount of time before the highest revenue investment can be purchased. This intuition is sketched in the figure below, where the naive waiter (red) waits until they can purchase a hypothetical maximum revenue investment for 200, and the MinWait algorithm makes an investment for 100 that increases revenue enough to purchase the maximum revenue investment faster than the naive waiter:\nFormally, this algorithm first computes the wait until the maximum revenue investment can be purchased (\\(w_{max}\\)), then searches for investments that can reduce the wait and purchases any that it finds. For a given current revenue \\(r_{t}\\) and cost of the maximum revenue investment, \\(c_{max}\\), the wait until this investment can be purchased is \\(w_{max}=\\frac{c_{max}}{r_t}\\), which corresponds to the time when the red line reaches 200. This formula ignores current balance, but in the appendix I show that the current balance is irrelevant for the purchasing decision. An alternative investment, \\(b\\), could improve the wait time if it’s addition to revenue is large enough to make up for its cost before the time \\(w_{max}\\). This is shown with the blue dashed line in the example above. If investment \\(b\\) adds \\(r_b\\) to the current revenue \\(r_t\\), and costs \\(c_b\\), then the wait until the maximum revenue investment if \\(b\\) is purchased is: \\(w_b = \\frac{c_b}{r_t}+\\frac{c_a}{r_t+r_b}\\). This algorithm buys \\(b\\) if \\(w_b\u0026lt;w_{max}\\); that is, if purchasing \\(b\\) reduces the wait until the maximum revenue investment can be purchased.\nThe code I used to implement this is provided below.\n# Max RPS/price agent class agent_class_min_wait(agent_class_naive): # overwrite the buy_products method for this agent\u0026#39;s purchase logic def buy_products(self): ## update building info self.get_building_info() # while best building affordable, buy it and look for next best building best_building_affordable = True while best_building_affordable: ## get unlocked products products = (driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) + driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked disabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)) # find building with max revenue per second and it\u0026#39;s cost max_rps,cost_max_rps = 0, float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) building_to_buy,product_to_buy = [], [] for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): # get rps for building cur_rps = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;] # if it\u0026#39;s the best rps far, update max, cost, and building id if cur_rps \u0026gt; max_rps: max_rps,building_to_buy = cur_rps,building cost_max_rps = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] product_to_buy = products[i] # queue this building to buy # update revenue for computations below self.log_balance_and_revenue() # check if any other purchase would reduce wait time to buying max_rps product wait_max = float(cost_max_rps) / self.revenue if self.revenue else 0 # stops division by 0 for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): cost_cur = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] rps_cur = self.revenue + self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;] # conditional to stop division by 0 wait_till_cur = float(cost_cur) / self.revenue if self.revenue else 0 wait_cur = (wait_till_cur + cost_max_rps / rps_cur) if wait_cur \u0026lt;= wait_max: wait_max = wait_cur # update minimum wait building_to_buy = building product_to_buy = products[i] # queue this building to buy instead # update balance for checking if building affordable self.log_balance_and_revenue() # buy either max_rps product, or the building that would reduce wait time # check if best building is affordable if self.building_info[building_to_buy][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]\u0026lt;=self.balance: # buy building_to_buy (click on this product) product_to_buy.click() # update building info (including rps per price rps_pp) self.get_building_info() else: best_building_affordable=False # if not affordable, break purchase loop  This implementation again extends the agent_class_naive class by replacing the buy_products method. The algorithm makes two passes through the list of unlocked investments. The fist pass is copied below:\n# find building with max revenue per second and it\u0026#39;s cost max_rps,cost_max_rps = 0, float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) building_to_buy,product_to_buy = [], [] for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): # get rps for building cur_rps = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;] # if it\u0026#39;s the best rps far, update max, cost, and building id if cur_rps \u0026gt; max_rps: max_rps,building_to_buy = cur_rps,building cost_max_rps = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] product_to_buy = products[i] # queue this building to buy Similar to that used in the MaxROI agent, this code is an \\(O(N)\\) search through the \\(N\\) unlocked buildings. It logs the maximum revenue in max_rps and the building associated with this revenue in building_to_buy, as well as the web element to click in order to purchase this building, product_to_buy.\nThen the agent computes \\(w_{max}\\) with:\nwait_max = float(cost_max_rps) / self.revenue if self.revenue else 0 # stops division by 0 The (value) if (condition) else 0 is used to stop division by 0 – if self.revenue is 0, then wait_max will take the value 0 rather than the computed value which is undefined when self.revenue is 0.\nNext, another pass through the list of buildings, this time searching for a building that will reduce the wait time:\nfor i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): cost_cur = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] rps_cur = self.revenue + self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;] # conditional to stop division by 0 wait_till_cur = float(cost_cur) / self.revenue if self.revenue else 0 wait_cur = (wait_till_cur + cost_max_rps / rps_cur) if wait_cur \u0026lt;= wait_max: wait_max = wait_cur # update minimum wait building_to_buy = building product_to_buy = products[i] # queue this building to buy instead Here the MinWait agent gets the cost of a candidate investment, cost_cur and the revenue that would be attained if this investment is bought rps_cur. Then computes the time before this candidate investment could be bought at the current revenue, wait_till_cur and finally computes \\(w_b\\), the wait until the maximum revenue option could be bought if the candidate investment is bought first as wait_cur. Lastly, if this is lower than wait_max (\\(w_{max}\\)), then the agent stores the best wait in wait_max and updates the building to buy and the web element to click.\nLike the MaxROI agent, the last few lines of code check if the investment is affordable, and if not, terminates the ends the purchasing loop.\n  Performance Each agent class was instantiated as agent and run for 100,000 big cookie clicks, with the purchase logic run after every 200 clicks. The Naive, MaxROI, and MinWait agents ran for approximately 3650 seconds, 3785 seconds, and 3800 seconds, respectively. The differences in runtime were small enough that I wasn’t worried about differences in the performance metrics below being attributable to extra income earned from a longer runtime.\nRevenue First I looked at the main metric, revenue per second, shown in the figure below:\n The MaxROI and MinWait strategies clearly performed better than the Naive strategy in terms of maximizing revenue per second. It also appeared that the MaxROI algorithm generally had higher revenue when in a purchasing cycle, but the MinWait algorithm surpassed the MaxROI algorithm when waiting for a large purchase.\n Building Count  The Naive agent purchases each investment at about the same rate. At the other extreme, MinWait agent generally saves for the highest revenue option, then occasionally buys cheaper options to reduce the wait until the next purchase of the highest revenue option. This is most clearly seen in the spikes across buildings soon after a new, expensive, building is purchased. Like the Naive agent, the MaxROI agent also buys each investment frequently, however this agent prioritizes the investments that give the best return on investment.\n Building Prices  The Naieve strategy results in equalizing prices, while both the MaxROI and MinWait strategies can save to purchase the most expensive investment.\n Return on Investment (Revenue Per Cost)  The Naive strategy rarely chooses the best ROI option. The MaxROI strategy equalizes the ratio between revenue and price across the investments, while the MinWait strategy similarly picks options with a good ratio here but also frequently chooses worse deals. Overall the Naive and MinWait strategies often end up paying more than they should for revenue.\n  Conclusions Both the MaxROI and MinWait agents perform far better than the Naive agent in terms of maximizing revenue. The MaxROI agent performed better when in a buying cycle, but the MinWait agent surpassed the MaxROI agent during long periods of saving for an expensive purchase. Perhaps a better algorithm would be a hybrid that follows the MaxROI strategy when all revenues are known, and uses the MinWait strategy when saving up for an expensive option with an unknown revenue.\n Appendix: MinWait Decision is Independent of Balance Another consideration for the MinWait strategy was that the balance could reduce wait overall, and this might mathematically result in a preference reversal if the wait for \\(b\\) becomes negligably small. Accounting for balance and using \\(c_{max}\\) to represent the cost of the maximum revenue option, \\(r_t\\) to represent the current revenue, \\(c_b\\) to represent the cost of another investment, and \\(r_b\\) to be the additional revenue provided by that investment, the wait time calculations become;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} w_{max} \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_{max}-balance}{r_t} \\\\ w_{b} \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_b-balance}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b} \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe the decision rule can be cast as: buy \\(b\\) if \\(w_{max} - w_{b}\u0026lt;0\\). This results in the decision function:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} w_{max} - w_{b} \u0026amp; = \\frac{c_{max}-balance}{r_t} - \\left(\\frac{c_b-balance}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b}\\right) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_{max}-balance-c_b+balance}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_{max}-c_b}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe same function results from \\(w_{max}=\\frac{c_{max}}{r_t}\\) and \\(w_{b} = \\frac{c_b}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b}\\), hence the decision does not depend on balance.\n Helper Functions The base agent class, agent_class_naive, contained many helper functions as well as the naive investment purchasing logic. This section explains the code used for the helper functions.\nBrowser and Game Initialization The agent was initialized with a web driver object stored in driver. The first part of the agent class __init__ method is copied below:\nclass agent_class_naive: def __init__(self,driver): # navigate to site driver.get(\u0026#39;https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/\u0026#39;) time.sleep(10) # time for page to load self.big_cookie = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;bigCookie\u0026#39;) self.golden_cookie_clicks = 0 # initialize balance and revenue variables self.balance=0 self.revenue=0 # initialize balance and revenue logs self.log_balance=[0] self.log_revenue=[0] self.log_bal_rev_epoch=[0] # initialize building info, and logs of building info self.get_building_info() self.log_build_info = dict() self.building_info_logger(epoch=0) ... First the agent navigates the webdriver to the Cookie Clicker URL and pauses for 10 seconds to let the page load. After that, the agent finds the big cookie web element and assigns it to attribute big_cookie. The remaining lines above initialize various attributes that were either used in purchasing logic, or used to log data on agent performance.\nThe second part of the __init__ method navigated to the ‘options’ tab and changed the game settings. One important setting to change was the numbersButton option – this toggled between displaying numbers numerically, ‘1,000,000’, versus with words, ‘1 million’. Since the balance is scraped from this text, the agents require that numbers be displayed numerically. The other changed settings related to graphics and game performance. Code for this second part of __init__ is shown below:\n # CHANGE GRAPHICS AND OTHER SETTINGS # click \u0026#39;options\u0026#39; tab driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026quot;prefsButton\u0026quot;).click() time.sleep(1) # let page load # disable text instead of numbers, e.g. \u0026#39;million\u0026#39; -\u0026gt; \u0026#39;000,000\u0026#39; driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026quot;numbersButton\u0026quot;).click() # slide volume to around 25% time.sleep(.5) # so actions don\u0026#39;t happen too fast volume = driver.find_element_by_class_name(\u0026quot;slider\u0026quot;) move = ActionChains(driver) move.click_and_hold(volume).move_by_offset(-50, 0).release().perform() # change graphics for optimal performance buttons = (\u0026quot;fancyButton\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;particlesButton\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;cursorsButton\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;milkButton\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;wobblyButton\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;cookiesoundButton\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;formatButton\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;extraButtonsButton\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;customGrandmasButton\u0026quot;) for button in buttons: time.sleep(.5) # so actions don\u0026#39;t happen too fast to execute driver.find_element_by_id(button).click()  Clicking Cookies A simple, important function, click_cookie() effects the cookie click. The game also has golden cookies that provide a large lump sum of cookies, or transient increases in revenue. Golden cookies appear at random times, and at random locations on the screen. The second function below identifies and clicks these golden cookies until there are no more golden cookies on the screen, and logs the number of golden cookie clicks.\n def click_cookie(self): self.big_cookie.click() def click_golden_cookie(self): golden_cookies = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;shimmer\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) while len(golden_cookies)\u0026gt;0: # if there are products, and while we can afford products, for golden_cookie in golden_cookies: golden_cookie.click() # buy each one self.golden_cookie_clicks+=1 golden_cookies = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;shimmer\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)  Purchasing Upgrades Upgrades are another way to spend cookies. The function below finds affordable upgrades and purchases (click) them, starting with the most expensive avilable upgrade.\n def buy_upgrades(self): upgrades = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;crate upgrade enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) while len(upgrades)\u0026gt;0: # if there are products, and while we can afford products, try: upgrades[-1].click() # buy each one, most expensive first except: None upgrades = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;crate upgrade enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)  Logging balance and revenue Balance and revenue were important for some strategies and were logged as a metric to compare the agents. To facilitate both use cases, I created a method that took an argument epoch. This method parses the text above the big cookie to convert a string like ‘177 cookies \\n per second: 1.1’ to extract the balance of 177 and revenue of 1.1. If the method is called without an epoch, then it only updates the balance and revenue. Alternatively, if an epoch is passed, then this method also logs the balance, revenue, and eopch or click number. The code for this is shown below:\n def log_balance_and_revenue(self,epoch=None): # parse string with balance and revenue tmp = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@id=\u0026quot;cookies\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) tmp = tmp[0].text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) # remove camas 1,000 -\u0026gt; 1000 tmp = re.findall(\u0026quot;\\d+\u0026quot;,tmp) # extract balance and revenue tmp = [int(i) for i in tmp] # convert str -\u0026gt; int # update balance and revenue self.balance = tmp[0] # update current balance self.revenue = tmp[1] # update revenue # if epoch passed, log balance and revenue at this epoch if epoch: self.log_bal_rev_epoch.append(epoch) # index for balance and revenue self.log_balance.append(tmp[0]) # log balance self.log_revenue.append(tmp[1]) # log revenue  Get building information Building information like the cost and revenue was used in purchasing logic. The code used to extract this is shown below, and each component is elaborated on afterwards:\n def get_building_info(self): # get unlocked products products_unlocked = (driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) + driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked disabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)) # info for unlocked buildings building_info = dict() for i,building in enumerate(products_unlocked): # get info from building button tmp=building.text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;).split(sep=\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;) building_name,building_price,building_count = tmp if len(tmp)==3 else tmp+[0] # initialize dict for building building_info[building_name] = dict() # fill in count and price building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;count\u0026#39;]=int(building_count) building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]=int(building_price) # get info from building tooltip hover = ActionChains(driver).move_to_element(building) hover.perform() tooltip = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@id=\u0026quot;tooltip\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) tmp=tooltip[0].text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); tmp_cps = re.findall(r\u0026quot;produces [-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|produces \\d+\u0026quot;,tmp); # \u0026gt; \u0026#39;produces X\u0026#39; if tmp_cps: # if building has been purchased tmp_cps_2=float(re.findall(r\u0026quot;[-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|\\d+\u0026quot;,tmp_cps[0])[0]) building_cps = tmp_cps_2 else: # if building hasn\u0026#39;t been purchased, store cps as infinity building_cps = float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) # \u0026gt; X #### default of inf below encourages purchasing unlocked, unowned buildings #building_cps = float(tmp_cps[0][:tmp_cps[0].find(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;)]) if tmp_cps else float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;]=building_cps building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;cps/price\u0026#39;]=building_cps/int(building_price) self.building_info = building_info This code first obtains a list of the buildings that are unlocked, products_unlocked, then iterates over these to extract the relevant information: count or number owned, price of the next building, revenue, and the revenue to price ratio. Count and price could be obtained by parsing the text on the building button. This was done in the the following lines:\n# get info from building button tmp=building.text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;).split(sep=\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;) building_name,building_price,building_count = tmp if len(tmp)==3 else tmp+[0] # initialize dict for building building_info[building_name] = dict() # fill in count and price building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;count\u0026#39;]=int(building_count) building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]=int(building_price) Revenue could only be obtained from a tooltip that appeared when the mouse hovered over the building button. The code below effects a mouse hover over the building, then extracts and parses the text from the building tooltip;\n# get info from building tooltip hover = ActionChains(driver).move_to_element(building) hover.perform() tooltip = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@id=\u0026quot;tooltip\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) tmp=tooltip[0].text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); tmp_cps = re.findall(r\u0026quot;produces [-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|produces \\d+\u0026quot;,tmp); if tmp_cps: # if building has been purchased tmp_cps_2=float(re.findall(r\u0026quot;[-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|\\d+\u0026quot;,tmp_cps[0])[0]) building_cps = tmp_cps_2 else: # if building hasn\u0026#39;t been purchased, store cps as infinity building_cps = float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) One challenge was that the revenue was only viewable for owned buildings. To address this, I assumed a revenue of infinity for unowned buildings. This would incentivise agents that bought based on revenue to save and purchase the new building – which was reasonable because these buildings had higher revenue than the owned buildings. The last few lines in the code chunk above extract the revenue for owned buildings, and impute a revenue of infinity for unlocked but unowned buildings.\nFinally, the last few lines of code log the revenue and the return on investment (revenue divided by price) for each building and store the updated building information.\nSince this method was long already, I used a seperate method when logging this information. This logging function is shown below:\n def building_info_logger(self,epoch): if self.building_info: # if self.building_info exists # modified from get_building_info to append. log_keys = [\u0026#39;count\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;cps/price\u0026#39;] # info for unlocked buildings for building in self.building_info: # initialize new buildings if building not in self.log_build_info: self.log_build_info[building] = dict() for k in log_keys+[\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;]: self.log_build_info[building][k]=[] # fill in count,price,cps, cps/price for k in log_keys: self.log_build_info[building][k].append(self.building_info[building][k]) # log epoch, within each building since buildings become available at different times self.log_build_info[building][\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;].append(epoch)    ","date":1564761569,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564761569,"objectID":"15924bd008cba0bb0f0b25969f503971","permalink":"/MacStrelioff/data-science/cookie-clicker-bot/","publishdate":"2019-08-02T15:59:29Z","relpermalink":"/MacStrelioff/data-science/cookie-clicker-bot/","section":"data-science","summary":"Overview Background and Setup Cookie Clicker Game  Agents Naive: Buy all affordable investments MaxROI: Buy best return on investment MinWait: Buy what minimizes the time to the highest revenue purchase  Performance Revenue Building Count Building Prices Return on Investment (Revenue Per Cost)  Conclusions Appendix: MinWait Decision is Independent of Balance Helper Functions Browser and Game Initialization Clicking Cookies Purchasing Upgrades Logging balance and revenue Get building information     Overview Lately I’ve been interested in writing algorithms (agents) that interact with websites.","tags":null,"title":"Example Web Agent","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Overview Background and Setup Cookie Clicker Game  Agents Naive: Buy all affordable investments MaxROI: Buy best return on investment MinWait: Buy what minimizes the time to the highest revenue purchase  Performance Revenue Building Count Building Prices Return on Investment (Revenue Per Cost)  Conclusions Appendix: MinWait Decision is Independent of Balance Helper Functions Browser and Game Initialization Clicking Cookies Purchasing Upgrades Logging balance and revenue Get building information     Overview Lately I’ve been interested in writing algorithms (agents) that interact with websites. The game Cookie Clicker is a great testing ground for such algorithms. The game is played by clicking a big cooke to earn money (cookies) that can be used to invest in instruments (buy buildings), which in turn generate revenue (more cookies). Here I’ll describe three agents that I made for this game and assess their performance. I also describe many of the helper functions involved in implementing these agents. The code that implements these agents and reproduces all figures in this blog post can be found on my GitHub, here: https://github.com/MacStrelioff/CookieClickerAgent\n Background and Setup Cookie Clicker Game The interface for Cookie Clicker is shown below.\n The goal of the game is to amass wealth in the form of cookies. Your balance and revenue are shown above the large cookie. Cookies are earned each time you click the large cookie and investments, shown at the bottom right, are unlocked as you acquire wealth. Purchasing an investment (Cursor, Grandma, …) provides recurring revenue in cookies per second. For any specific investment, the price of the next investment increases each time the investment is purchased. In developing the algorithms below I focused on maximizing revenue, which would maximize wealth over time.\nThe game has other mechanics (upgrades, ascension, golden cookies, …). I programed functions to purchase upgrades and click golden cookies, but these functions were disabled in the analyses below to allow for a controlled comparison of the agents.\n  Agents While the goal was to earn as many cookies as possible, the game also allows revenue to accrue while the player is away, and the amount of cookies earned per click can scale with revenue. For these reasons, I focused on maximizing revenue as the overall goal for any strategy.\nNaive: Buy all affordable investments The simplest investment strategy was to purchase any affordable building. This is implemented in the code below:\nclass agent_class_naive: ... def buy_products(self): products = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) while products: # if there are affordable products, buy them products[-1].click() products = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) ... Here products is a list of the web elements that represent the affordable buildings, and the while loop cycles over them, buying the most expensive ones first with products[-1].click(), until no more buildings are affordable. This purchasing logic is implemented through a buy_products method of the naive agent, agent_class_naive. In my code, the naive agent class also contained the necessary helper functions, described in the section above.\n MaxROI: Buy best return on investment The second strategy is to buy the option that will have the best return on investment (revenue to price ratio). The code below extends the naive agent, agent_class_naive, by overriding the buy_products method that implements the investment strategy.\nclass agent_class_max_rps_price_ratio(agent_class_naive): # overwrite the buy_products method def buy_products(self): ## update building info self.get_building_info() # while best is affordable, buy the best rps/price building best_building_affordable = True while best_building_affordable: ## get unlocked products products = (driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) + driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked disabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)) # find max rps/price building max_rps_pp,building_to_buy,product_to_buy = 0,[],[] for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): # get rps/price for building cur_rps_pp = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps/price\u0026#39;] # if it\u0026#39;s the best so far, update max and building id if cur_rps_pp \u0026gt; max_rps_pp: max_rps_pp,building_to_buy = cur_rps_pp,building product_to_buy = products[i] # store element to click # update balance self.log_balance_and_revenue() # check if best building is affordable. if self.building_info[building_to_buy][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]\u0026lt;=self.balance: # buy building_to_buy (click on this product) product_to_buy.click() # update building info (including rps per price rps_pp) self.get_building_info() else: best_building_affordable=False # if not affordable, break the loop  First the MaxROI agent updates building information, including; cookies per second, price, and the ratio cps/price, using the helper method get_building_info(). Then it purchases the buildings that provide the max ROI, until the best building by this metric is unaffordable. The search for the best building is implemented in the section:\n# find max rps/price building max_rps_pp,building_to_buy,product_to_buy = 0,[],[] for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): # get rps/price for building cur_rps_pp = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps/price\u0026#39;] # if it\u0026#39;s the best so far, update max and building id if cur_rps_pp \u0026gt; max_rps_pp: max_rps_pp,building_to_buy = cur_rps_pp,building product_to_buy = products[i] # store element to click This is an \\(O(N)\\) search through the buildings that have information, where \\(N\\) is the number of buildings. This code logs the maximum ROI in max_rps_pp and the building associated with this ROI in building_to_buy, as well as the web element to click in order to purchase this building, product_to_buy. After the best ROI investment is found, the next few lines of code update the agent’s balance and check if the investment is affordable. If it is, the agent buys it and this process repeats, if it is not then best_building_affordable is set to False which ends the while loop.\n MinWait: Buy what minimizes the time to the highest revenue purchase The intuition of this strategy is to buy the investment that maximizes revenue, however, those investments can be expensive. Other investments may increase revenue enough to decrease the amount of time before the highest revenue investment can be purchased. This intuition is sketched in the figure below, where the naive waiter (red) waits until they can purchase a hypothetical maximum revenue investment for 200, and the MinWait algorithm makes an investment for 100 that increases revenue enough to purchase the maximum revenue investment faster than the naive waiter:\nFormally, this algorithm first computes the wait until the maximum revenue investment can be purchased (\\(w_{max}\\)), then searches for investments that can reduce the wait and purchases any that it finds. For a given current revenue \\(r_{t}\\) and cost of the maximum revenue investment, \\(c_{max}\\), the wait until this investment can be purchased is \\(w_{max}=\\frac{c_{max}}{r_t}\\), which corresponds to the time when the red line reaches 200. This formula ignores current balance, but in the appendix I show that the current balance is irrelevant for the purchasing decision. An alternative investment, \\(b\\), could improve the wait time if it’s addition to revenue is large enough to make up for its cost before the time \\(w_{max}\\). This is shown with the blue dashed line in the example above. If investment \\(b\\) adds \\(r_b\\) to the current revenue \\(r_t\\), and costs \\(c_b\\), then the wait until the maximum revenue investment if \\(b\\) is purchased is: \\(w_b = \\frac{c_b}{r_t}+\\frac{c_a}{r_t+r_b}\\). This algorithm buys \\(b\\) if \\(w_b\u0026lt;w_{max}\\); that is, if purchasing \\(b\\) reduces the wait until the maximum revenue investment can be purchased.\nThe code I used to implement this is provided below.\n# Max RPS/price agent class agent_class_min_wait(agent_class_naive): # overwrite the buy_products method for this agent\u0026#39;s purchase logic def buy_products(self): ## update building info self.get_building_info() # while best building affordable, buy it and look for next best building best_building_affordable = True while best_building_affordable: ## get unlocked products products = (driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) + driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked disabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)) # find building with max revenue per second and it\u0026#39;s cost max_rps,cost_max_rps = 0, float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) building_to_buy,product_to_buy = [], [] for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): # get rps for building cur_rps = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;] # if it\u0026#39;s the best rps far, update max, cost, and building id if cur_rps \u0026gt; max_rps: max_rps,building_to_buy = cur_rps,building cost_max_rps = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] product_to_buy = products[i] # queue this building to buy # update revenue for computations below self.log_balance_and_revenue() # check if any other purchase would reduce wait time to buying max_rps product wait_max = float(cost_max_rps) / self.revenue if self.revenue else 0 # stops division by 0 for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): cost_cur = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] rps_cur = self.revenue + self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;] # conditional to stop division by 0 wait_till_cur = float(cost_cur) / self.revenue if self.revenue else 0 wait_cur = (wait_till_cur + cost_max_rps / rps_cur) if wait_cur \u0026lt;= wait_max: wait_max = wait_cur # update minimum wait building_to_buy = building product_to_buy = products[i] # queue this building to buy instead # update balance for checking if building affordable self.log_balance_and_revenue() # buy either max_rps product, or the building that would reduce wait time # check if best building is affordable if self.building_info[building_to_buy][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]\u0026lt;=self.balance: # buy building_to_buy (click on this product) product_to_buy.click() # update building info (including rps per price rps_pp) self.get_building_info() else: best_building_affordable=False # if not affordable, break purchase loop  This implementation again extends the agent_class_naive class by replacing the buy_products method. The algorithm makes two passes through the list of unlocked investments. The fist pass is copied below:\n# find building with max revenue per second and it\u0026#39;s cost max_rps,cost_max_rps = 0, float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) building_to_buy,product_to_buy = [], [] for i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): # get rps for building cur_rps = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;] # if it\u0026#39;s the best rps far, update max, cost, and building id if cur_rps \u0026gt; max_rps: max_rps,building_to_buy = cur_rps,building cost_max_rps = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] product_to_buy = products[i] # queue this building to buy Similar to that used in the MaxROI agent, this code is an \\(O(N)\\) search through the \\(N\\) unlocked buildings. It logs the maximum revenue in max_rps and the building associated with this revenue in building_to_buy, as well as the web element to click in order to purchase this building, product_to_buy.\nThen the agent computes \\(w_{max}\\) with:\nwait_max = float(cost_max_rps) / self.revenue if self.revenue else 0 # stops division by 0 The (value) if (condition) else 0 is used to stop division by 0 – if self.revenue is 0, then wait_max will take the value 0 rather than the computed value which is undefined when self.revenue is 0.\nNext, another pass through the list of buildings, this time searching for a building that will reduce the wait time:\nfor i,building in enumerate(self.building_info): cost_cur = self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] rps_cur = self.revenue + self.building_info[building][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;] # conditional to stop division by 0 wait_till_cur = float(cost_cur) / self.revenue if self.revenue else 0 wait_cur = (wait_till_cur + cost_max_rps / rps_cur) if wait_cur \u0026lt;= wait_max: wait_max = wait_cur # update minimum wait building_to_buy = building product_to_buy = products[i] # queue this building to buy instead Here the MinWait agent gets the cost of a candidate investment, cost_cur and the revenue that would be attained if this investment is bought rps_cur. Then computes the time before this candidate investment could be bought at the current revenue, wait_till_cur and finally computes \\(w_b\\), the wait until the maximum revenue option could be bought if the candidate investment is bought first as wait_cur. Lastly, if this is lower than wait_max (\\(w_{max}\\)), then the agent stores the best wait in wait_max and updates the building to buy and the web element to click.\nLike the MaxROI agent, the last few lines of code check if the investment is affordable, and if not, terminates the ends the purchasing loop.\n  Performance Each agent class was instantiated as agent and run for 100,000 big cookie clicks, with the purchase logic run after every 200 clicks. The Naive, MaxROI, and MinWait agents ran for approximately 3650 seconds, 3785 seconds, and 3800 seconds, respectively. The differences in runtime were small enough that I wasn’t worried about differences in the performance metrics below being attributable to extra income earned from a longer runtime.\nRevenue First I looked at the main metric, revenue per second, shown in the figure below:\n The MaxROI and MinWait strategies clearly performed better than the Naive strategy in terms of maximizing revenue per second. It also appeared that the MaxROI algorithm generally had higher revenue when in a purchasing cycle, but the MinWait algorithm surpassed the MaxROI algorithm when waiting for a large purchase.\n Building Count  The Naive agent purchases each investment at about the same rate. At the other extreme, MinWait agent generally saves for the highest revenue option, then occasionally buys cheaper options to reduce the wait until the next purchase of the highest revenue option. This is most clearly seen in the spikes across buildings soon after a new, expensive, building is purchased. Like the Naive agent, the MaxROI agent also buys each investment frequently, however this agent prioritizes the investments that give the best return on investment.\n Building Prices  The Naieve strategy results in equalizing prices, while both the MaxROI and MinWait strategies can save to purchase the most expensive investment.\n Return on Investment (Revenue Per Cost)  The Naive strategy rarely chooses the best ROI option. The MaxROI strategy equalizes the ratio between revenue and price across the investments, while the MinWait strategy similarly picks options with a good ratio here but also frequently chooses worse deals. Overall the Naive and MinWait strategies often end up paying more than they should for revenue.\n  Conclusions Both the MaxROI and MinWait agents perform far better than the Naive agent in terms of maximizing revenue. The MaxROI agent performed better when in a buying cycle, but the MinWait agent surpassed the MaxROI agent during long periods of saving for an expensive purchase. Perhaps a better algorithm would be a hybrid that follows the MaxROI strategy when all revenues are known, and uses the MinWait strategy when saving up for an expensive option with an unknown revenue.\n Appendix: MinWait Decision is Independent of Balance Another consideration for the MinWait strategy was that the balance could reduce wait overall, and this might mathematically result in a preference reversal if the wait for \\(b\\) becomes negligably small. Accounting for balance and using \\(c_{max}\\) to represent the cost of the maximum revenue option, \\(r_t\\) to represent the current revenue, \\(c_b\\) to represent the cost of another investment, and \\(r_b\\) to be the additional revenue provided by that investment, the wait time calculations become;\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} w_{max} \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_{max}-balance}{r_t} \\\\ w_{b} \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_b-balance}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b} \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe the decision rule can be cast as: buy \\(b\\) if \\(w_{max} - w_{b}\u0026lt;0\\). This results in the decision function:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} w_{max} - w_{b} \u0026amp; = \\frac{c_{max}-balance}{r_t} - \\left(\\frac{c_b-balance}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b}\\right) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_{max}-balance-c_b+balance}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_{max}-c_b}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe same function results from \\(w_{max}=\\frac{c_{max}}{r_t}\\) and \\(w_{b} = \\frac{c_b}{r_t} + \\frac{c_{max}}{r_t+r_b}\\), hence the decision does not depend on balance.\n Helper Functions The base agent class, agent_class_naive, contained many helper functions as well as the naive investment purchasing logic. This section explains the code used for the helper functions.\nBrowser and Game Initialization The agent was initialized with a web driver object stored in driver. The first part of the agent class __init__ method is copied below:\nclass agent_class_naive: def __init__(self,driver): # navigate to site driver.get(\u0026#39;https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/\u0026#39;) time.sleep(10) # time for page to load self.big_cookie = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;bigCookie\u0026#39;) self.golden_cookie_clicks = 0 # initialize balance and revenue variables self.balance=0 self.revenue=0 # initialize balance and revenue logs self.log_balance=[0] self.log_revenue=[0] self.log_bal_rev_epoch=[0] # initialize building info, and logs of building info self.get_building_info() self.log_build_info = dict() self.building_info_logger(epoch=0) ... First the agent navigates the webdriver to the Cookie Clicker URL and pauses for 10 seconds to let the page load. After that, the agent finds the big cookie web element and assigns it to attribute big_cookie. The remaining lines above initialize various attributes that were either used in purchasing logic, or used to log data on agent performance.\nThe second part of the __init__ method navigated to the ‘options’ tab and changed the game settings. One important setting to change was the numbersButton option – this toggled between displaying numbers numerically, ‘1,000,000’, versus with words, ‘1 million’. Since the balance is scraped from this text, the agents require that numbers be displayed numerically. The other changed settings related to graphics and game performance.

The game also has golden cookies that provide a large lump sum of cookies, or transient increases in revenue. Golden cookies appear at random times, and at random locations on the screen. The second function below identifies and clicks these golden cookies until there are no more golden cookies on the screen, and logs the number of golden cookie clicks.\n def click_cookie(self): self.big_cookie.click() def click_golden_cookie(self): golden_cookies = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;shimmer\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) while len(golden_cookies)\u0026gt;0: # if there are products, and while we can afford products, for golden_cookie in golden_cookies: golden_cookie.click() # buy each one self.golden_cookie_clicks+=1 golden_cookies = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;shimmer\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)  Purchasing Upgrades Upgrades are another way to spend cookies. The function below finds affordable upgrades and purchases (click) them, starting with the most expensive avilable upgrade.\n def buy_upgrades(self): upgrades = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;crate upgrade enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) while len(upgrades)\u0026gt;0: # if there are products, and while we can afford products, try: upgrades[-1].click() # buy each one, most expensive first except: None upgrades = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;crate upgrade enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)  Logging balance and revenue Balance and revenue were important for some strategies and were logged as a metric to compare the agents. To facilitate both use cases, I created a method that took an argument epoch. This method parses the text above the big cookie to convert a string like ‘177 cookies \\n per second: 1.1’ to extract the balance of 177 and revenue of 1.1. If the method is called without an epoch, then it only updates the balance and revenue. Alternatively, if an epoch is passed, then this method also logs the balance, revenue, and eopch or click number. The code for this is shown below:\n def log_balance_and_revenue(self,epoch=None): # parse string with balance and revenue tmp = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@id=\u0026quot;cookies\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) tmp = tmp[0].text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) # remove camas 1,000 -\u0026gt; 1000 tmp = re.findall(\u0026quot;\\d+\u0026quot;,tmp) # extract balance and revenue tmp = [int(i) for i in tmp] # convert str -\u0026gt; int # update balance and revenue self.balance = tmp[0] # update current balance self.revenue = tmp[1] # update revenue # if epoch passed, log balance and revenue at this epoch if epoch: self.log_bal_rev_epoch.append(epoch) # index for balance and revenue self.log_balance.append(tmp[0]) # log balance self.log_revenue.append(tmp[1]) # log revenue  Get building information Building information like the cost and revenue was used in purchasing logic. The code used to extract this is shown below, and each component is elaborated on afterwards:\n def get_building_info(self): # get unlocked products products_unlocked = (driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked enabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) + driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@class=\u0026quot;product unlocked disabled\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;)) # info for unlocked buildings building_info = dict() for i,building in enumerate(products_unlocked): # get info from building button tmp=building.text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;).split(sep=\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;) building_name,building_price,building_count = tmp if len(tmp)==3 else tmp+[0] # initialize dict for building building_info[building_name] = dict() # fill in count and price building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;count\u0026#39;]=int(building_count) building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]=int(building_price) # get info from building tooltip hover = ActionChains(driver).move_to_element(building) hover.perform() tooltip = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@id=\u0026quot;tooltip\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) tmp=tooltip[0].text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); tmp_cps = re.findall(r\u0026quot;produces [-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|produces \\d+\u0026quot;,tmp); # \u0026gt; \u0026#39;produces X\u0026#39; if tmp_cps: # if building has been purchased tmp_cps_2=float(re.findall(r\u0026quot;[-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|\\d+\u0026quot;,tmp_cps[0])[0]) building_cps = tmp_cps_2 else: # if building hasn\u0026#39;t been purchased, store cps as infinity building_cps = float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) # \u0026gt; X #### default of inf below encourages purchasing unlocked, unowned buildings #building_cps = float(tmp_cps[0][:tmp_cps[0].find(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;)]) if tmp_cps else float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;]=building_cps building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;cps/price\u0026#39;]=building_cps/int(building_price) self.building_info = building_info This code first obtains a list of the buildings that are unlocked, products_unlocked, then iterates over these to extract the relevant information: count or number owned, price of the next building, revenue, and the revenue to price ratio. Count and price could be obtained by parsing the text on the building button. This was done in the the following lines:\n# get info from building button tmp=building.text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;).split(sep=\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;) building_name,building_price,building_count = tmp if len(tmp)==3 else tmp+[0] # initialize dict for building building_info[building_name] = dict() # fill in count and price building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;count\u0026#39;]=int(building_count) building_info[building_name][\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]=int(building_price) Revenue could only be obtained from a tooltip that appeared when the mouse hovered over the building button. The code below effects a mouse hover over the building, then extracts and parses the text from the building tooltip;\n# get info from building tooltip hover = ActionChains(driver).move_to_element(building) hover.perform() tooltip = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\u0026#39;//div[@id=\u0026quot;tooltip\u0026quot;]\u0026#39;) tmp=tooltip[0].text.replace(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); tmp_cps = re.findall(r\u0026quot;produces [-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|produces \\d+\u0026quot;,tmp); if tmp_cps: # if building has been purchased tmp_cps_2=float(re.findall(r\u0026quot;[-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|\\d+\u0026quot;,tmp_cps[0])[0]) building_cps = tmp_cps_2 else: # if building hasn\u0026#39;t been purchased, store cps as infinity building_cps = float(\u0026#39;inf\u0026#39;) One challenge was that the revenue was only viewable for owned buildings. To address this, I assumed a revenue of infinity for unowned buildings. This would incentivise agents that bought based on revenue to save and purchase the new building – which was reasonable because these buildings had higher revenue than the owned buildings. The last few lines in the code chunk above extract the revenue for owned buildings, and impute a revenue of infinity for unlocked but unowned buildings.\nFinally, the last few lines of code log the revenue and the return on investment (revenue divided by price) for each building and store the updated building information.\nSince this method was long already, I used a seperate method when logging this information. This logging function is shown below:\n def building_info_logger(self,epoch): if self.building_info: # if self.building_info exists # modified from get_building_info to append. log_keys = [\u0026#39;count\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;cps\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;cps/price\u0026#39;] # info for unlocked buildings for building in self.building_info: # initialize new buildings if building not in self.log_build_info: self.log_build_info[building] = dict() for k in log_keys+[\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;]: self.log_build_info[building][k]=[] # fill in count,price,cps, cps/price for k in log_keys: self.log_build_info[building][k].append(self.building_info[building][k]) # log epoch, within each building since buildings become available at different times self.log_build_info[building][\u0026#39;epoch\u0026#39;].append(epoch)    ","date":1564761393,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564761393,"objectID":"8545f58c4d8ed3e53d61205996e6eb2a","permalink":"/MacStrelioff/data-science/cookie_clicker_images/cookie-clicker-bot/","publishdate":"2019-08-02T15:56:33Z","relpermalink":"/MacStrelioff/data-science/cookie_clicker_images/cookie-clicker-bot/","section":"data-science","summary":"Overview Background and Setup Cookie Clicker Game  Agents Naive: Buy all affordable investments MaxROI: Buy best return on investment MinWait: Buy what minimizes the time to the highest revenue purchase  Performance Revenue Building Count Building Prices Return on Investment (Revenue Per Cost)  Conclusions Appendix: MinWait Decision is Independent of Balance Helper Functions Browser and Game Initialization Clicking Cookies Purchasing Upgrades Logging balance and revenue Get building information     Overview Lately I’ve been interested in writing algorithms (agents) that interact with websites.","tags":null,"title":"Cookie Clicker Agent","type":"data-science"},{"authors":["Mac Strelioff"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.

Intro Scientists and business students are trained in decision making from an outdated perspective – classical decision making based on p-values.\n(make a case against p-values – inflated error rates, incoherence, difficulty integrating with expected value)\n Bandit Algorithms Much of this is from this blog.\nHere I evaluate different algorithms for bandit problems similar to those anticipated in industry or testing settings. Criteria of consideration are;\nProblem Formalization Bandit tasks can be cast as a Markov Decision Process.\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} t \u0026amp;\\in \\{1,...,T\\} \\\\ a_t \u0026amp;\\in \\mathcal{A} \\\\ s_t \u0026amp;\\in \\mathcal{S} \\\\ r_t \u0026amp;= R(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t) = v(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t) \\\\ T(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t) \u0026amp;= p(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t) \\\\ \\pi(s_t)\u0026amp;=p(a_t|s_t) \\end{aligned} \\]\n\\(\\pi\\) is referred to as a policy or decision rule. Mathematically, it is a probability distribution over actions – a funciton that maps from states to actions.\nThe decision maker’s goal here is to learn a policy (\\(\\pi\\)) that is optimal for some criteria. A variety of possible criteria are discussed and evaluated below. This objective is considered when chooseing the value function \\(v(s_{t+1}|a_t,s_t)\\).\nObjective is to maximize \\[ E\\left(\\sum_t r_t\\right)=\\sum_tE(r_t) \\]\nIn a typical testing scenario, the policy replaces the assignment mechanism. Hence, I treat assignment mechanisms as policies here.\n Use Cases and Evaluation Criteria Bandit problems arise across many theoretical and applied fields. Everything from industry A/B testing, medical clinical trials, experimental lab studies, and toy problems for reinforcement learning algorithms can be cast as a bandit task. These different domains generally have different goals. A/B tests are conducted to find evidence for an advantage of one version of a product over another while emphasizing classical statistical objectives like minimizing type I error rates or false discovery rates. The goal of clinical experiments is to quickly discover the best treatment so that patient lives can be improved or saved. In simulation settings, bandit problems have been used to benchmark a variety of algorithms in terms of regret. Here I conduct similar benchmarks, while also evaluating standard ‘best proctices’ in terms of type I error rates and false discovery rates.\nType I Error Among situations where there is no difference, how often is a difference detected?\nType I error occurs when a null hypothesis is reongly rejected – so when a difference in outcomes of arms is detected when none actually exists.\n False Discovery Rate Among detected differences, how many are real?\nA false discovery occurs when an arm is selected but is not the actual optimal arm.\nI’ll consider this on a trial-by-trial level as well as the result of the overall experiment.\n Regret Regret is the difference between the reward that would have been obtained had the optimal action been chosen, and the reward that was actually obtained from the chosen action.\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} E(Regret) \u0026amp;= \\sum_t E(r^*_{t}-r_t) \\end{aligned} \\]\n  Uniform Policy This corresponds to a simple random sample type of assignment mechanism – the gold standard for causal inference from experimental data.\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\pi(s_t) \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}|} \\\\ E(Regret) \u0026amp;= TE(r^*_t) - \\sum_t E(r_t|\\pi) \\\\ \u0026amp;= T(E(r^*_t) - E(r_t)) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe expected regret on each trial is the difference between the maximal reward and mean reward across actions.\n Greedy Policies \\(\\epsilon\\)-Greedy Policy  Softmax Policy Might be good for parameter estimation while also reducing regret.\nna=5 # Number of arms as=1:na # action IDs beta = 5 R = runif(na) # arm probabilities #R[1]=1;

Their product was a SaaS application enabling team collaboration on shared files, and has a 30-day free trial model. Multiple users can be associated with an account, and users can have different roles that enable different privileges within the service. The overall goal was to identify free trial accounts that would convert to subscription-based paying customers.\nAt the request of the client, some of the information in this post has been masked so as to not reveal any confidential information.\n Business Need The survival of any company hinges on it’s ability to acquire new users. However, the majority of free trial users for my client failed to convert to customers. This leaves much opportunity to increase their userbase.\nProject Goals As a consultant, I helped with two major goals focused on issuing nudges to users in order to increase user acquisition:\nIdentify, as early as possible, patterns in user behavior that indicate whether a free trial user is likely to become a customer after the trial. Leverage those patterns to identify outreach strategies for users that might otherwise be unlikely to continue using the service..    Data sources and processing The original dataset consisted of account activity and product performance data for all accounts over a one year period. The dataset contained a large number of accounts, including some that were not germane to the project goals. Since the primary goal focused on behavior during the free trial, I excluded any accounts that were never on a free trial during the data collection period. In exploratory analysis, I found a large number of accounts that showed little to no activity. This prompted me to believe there are two types of trial accounts that do not convert to paying customers – 1) accounts that were created then never engaged with the product, and 2) accounts that engaged with the product, then failed to find the product valuable and decided to stop engagement. Since the strategies to address these accounts might differ, I decided to exclude any account without a minimal degree of engagement with the product and focus on the \\(2^{nd}\\) type of nonconversion. The criteria for a minimal level of engagement was chosen based on dependencies between product features, and decided during discussion with the client. Finally, some product features were not available during the full duration of data collection, as the product evolved over time. Since there was a large sample size, the easiest way to make the analyses pertinent for all features, and to keep accounts comparable to one another, was to exclude data collected before all product features were available.\nFeature Engineering and Exploration The original account activity data was in terms of counts of each possible action (e.g. workspaces created) on each date during data collection. To make the accounts easily comparable regardless of observation dates, I created a variable for account age (days since the account was created). Also, rather than working with daily counts I computed cumulative sums, which represented an account’s total usage aggregated over all its users’ activity of a product feature up to a particular age of their account. Finally, to mitigate confounding of the counts of activity by the number of users, I divided the cumulative sums by the number of users. These were features that I focused on – total usage of each product activity per user up to a particular day since the creation of the account.\nThe time of conversion could be many months after a trial had ended, as it may take time for a user associated with an organization to gain approval to purchase a subscription, or it may take time for a large organization to negotiate a price with my client. To focus on classifying free users as potential customers based on activity, I created a variable that indicated whether an account ever ended up as a customer. I then conceptualized the problem as a classification problem where, based on account activity over time since the account’s creation, I estimated the probability that the account would ever convert to a customer.\nI initially thought that the accounts that converted would differ in terms of the distribution of these features (cumulative activity per user), relative to those that did not convert. Hence, in exploration, I focused on probing this intuition by plotting the median and \\(20^{th}\\) to \\(80^{th}\\) quantiles of cross sections of these features across account age, split by users who ended up converting versus those who did not. An example, focusing on the number of workspaces created per user, is shown in the figure below. Classification would be easiest and most interpretable if there were features that the converters clearly used more than those who never converted.\nMedian (solid line) and middle 60% (shading) of the distribution of cumulative workspaces created per user, split by those who ever paid (blue) and those that were on a free trial forever (red)\n   Modeling Considerations My intuition about differing distributions is natrually expressed in linear discriminant analysis or quadratic discriminant analysis. However, these algorithms hinge on an assumption that the features are Gaussian distributed, which was clearly not the case – values were strictly non-negative, and distributions were skewed such that there were lots of values around 0 and some values far from the mean. Because of these violations, I also considered a support vector classifier with radial basis functions, and tree based algorithms – random forests, and gradient boosting decision trees (GBT). An advantage of the tree-based approaches is their robustness to any distribution of the features, and any functional relationship between the features and the probability of an account continuing product use after the free trial.\nAnother issue was class imbalance, since the majority of accounts did not continue. I used SMOTE, an algorithm that generates synthetic data from the underrepresented class (continuing customers), to address the class imbalance when fitting the model in training sets. I also considered metrics beyond accuracy, such as AUC and the F1 score, when selecting a final model.\n Initial Performance To quickly hone in on a model, I assessed the algorithms mentioned above with default hyperparameter values using scikit learn in Python. I focused on classification accuracy in a test set, and the tree-based algorithms outperformed the others by approximately 10%. This outperformance is likely due to the non-standard distributions of the features.\n Hyperparameter Tuning To assess performance across hyperparameters for the tree-based algorithms, I created validation curves with 5-fold cross validation and a set of hyperparameter values. The performance of both tree based algorithms was mostly stable in terms of F1 scores, except for poor performance when there were very few (\\(\u0026lt;10\\)) estimators. To mitigate potential overfitting, I increased the minimum number of observations in a leaf to 10, but left all other hyperparameters at their default values.\n Fitting Procedure I fit the random forests and GBT algorithms to cross-sections of the data at 7, 14, and 30 days since account creation. For each cross section, I split the data into 5 folds, and used SMOTE when training the algorithms within each fold to account for the class imbalance. In each fold, I logged the feature importances and performance metrics from both algorithms.\n  Actionable Results I used the mean feature importances across folds from the GBT algorithm to identify the features that differentiated between successful accounts and accounts with users that may have needed more onboarding. Since these features seperate continuing accounts from those that did not continue after the free trial, these are the features to prioritize when considering interventions to add value to the user’s experience.\nMean (bar length) and standard deviation (black error bars) of feature importance evaluated across the 5 folds for the gradient boosting trees algorithm. Feature names have been obscured at the client’s request.\n To understand the form of the relationship between these features and continued engagement after the trial, I binned accounts based on product feature usage and plotted the proportion of accounts that continued using the product after the free trial across these bins. Figures like this, paired with data on an individual account activity, could help in personalizing user outreach to focus on aligning users’ feature usage with that of users in more successful accounts. For example, based on the figure below, if an account has fewer than 1 workspace per user, their experience might be improved by resources that make workspace creation easier to understand or engage with.\nProportion of accounts that convert as a function of workspaces per user. There seems to be a bump in conversion rates from around 20% to around 40% above around 1 workspace per user.\n To identify struggling accounts for outreach, I applied the GBT algorithm to all data and focused on the confusion matrix, shown below. Different actions could be taken with respect to accounts in each quadrant. Accounts in the bottom right quadrant are currently customers, and were identified as such by the algorithm. These are the accounts with users who were successful in identifying value in the product and establishing an ongoing relationship with my client. Accounts in the top right quadrant are those who have not yet become customers, but are engaging with the product in ways that are similar to those who have become customers. Users in these accounts have likely identified valuable aspects of the product, and could be contacted by a customer success team to help them find a subscription plan that suits their needs.\nAccounts on the top left and bottom left quadrants were identified as accounts that would not continue with the product after the free trial – these are the accounts that may benefit from outreach that demonstrates the value this product can add to their workflows. Accounts in the top left quadrant were correctly identified as accounts that would not continue with the product. Users in these accounts may have failed to identify valuable aspects of the product, and may have had a better experience if they had been contacted early by customer support or had access to educational resources that could have helped them use the product. Accounts in the bottom left quadrant are those that became paying customers, but were incorrectly identified as accounts that would not continue with the product based on their activity in the first 7 days. Misclassifying these accounts has essentially no harm, as it would only encourage efforts to improve their experience early in their trial.\n Summary I began with an intuition that accounts that converted would have a different distribution of product feature usage per user, relative to those that did not convert, when feature usage was assessed at cross sections based on account age. To explore this, I looked at the quantiles of distributions across feature usage. Focusing on this with formal models, I found that tree-based algorithms could perform well across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, in identifying the accounts that converted, based on daily snapshots of aggregate feature usage.\nTo derive insights from this data and analysis, I focused on confusion matrices which identified free trial accounts that acted as if they would continue product usage, and accounts that were currently unlikely to continue with the product (those in need of educational resources, and/or contact from support teams). I focused on the features found to be important by the tree based algorithms in order to identify specific features to target when reaching out to users in struggling accounts. To discover how feature usage relates to a propensity to continue using the product, I looked at the proportion of accounts that continued after trial across levels of engagement with the important product features.\nOverall, my work provided valuable tools for identifying accounts to connect with for long term relationships or for onboarding and educational assistance, as well as feature usage patterns indicative of success with the product.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"88d1e86fdf825201ff65160488a6e85c","permalink":"/MacStrelioff/consultingproject/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/MacStrelioff/consultingproject/","section":"","summary":"Background As part of my fellowship at Insight Data Science, I worked on a 2 week consulting project with an external company.

Many important variables (future income, GDP, who I’ll marry, whether I’ll get sick, what disease I have given some symptoms, …)\n Randomness, Event Spaces, and Probability motivating example.. Imagine that a vaccine against a dangerous disease recently becomes available. However, there is a small risk that the vaccine will produce a condition just as bad as the disease itself. You do not know whether you will get the disease, or whether, given the vaccine, you will contract the side effect. Should you get the vaccine or abstain and live with a higher risk of disease?\nKnowledge of random variables, and related concepts, can help in this and many other situations. Specifically; %Knowing the probabilities of each event in the event space under conditions where you take or abstain from the vaccine could determine your decision.\nA random variable random variable is a variable with an unknown value, but known possible values. An event is an observed value of a random variable. An event space contains all possible values of the random variable. Probabilities are values assigned to the events in an event space (i.e. the possible values of a random variable) and represent how likely each event is relative to other events in the event space.\nHere \\(p(e)\\) will be used to represent the probability of an event. Some special probabilities include the probability of any event in the event space, which is 1. And the probability of any event other than \\(p(e)\\), known as the compliment of \\(p(e)\\), denoted with \\(p(\\neg e)\\), is found by; \\[\\begin{equation} p(\\neg e) = 1 - p(e) \\end{equation}\\] For example, the value observed when a six sided die is rolled could be considered a random variable with possible values of 1 through 6. Rolling the die could be an experiment, and, if a 5 lands face up, then 5 would be the outcome.\nProbabilities are often thought of with reference to experiments and outcomes. In this context, an experiment is any opportunity to observe a relevant outcome. Outcomes are the consequences of an experiment, and one is typically interested in outcomes of a particular kind. For example, if coin flips are thought of as an experiment, then the outcomes of this experiment could be heads or tails. In this context, probabilities assign numbers to the outcomes (e.g. heads, or tails) of an experiment (e.g. coin toss).\nsee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations\ndefine event define event space as all the events that could happen probability = events of interest / all possible events\n Joint Events and the Multiplication Rule A joint event refers to two or more events occurring together. They are colloquially talked about as one event ‘and’ another event occurring together. More formally, joint events are called intersections (represented with the \\(\\cap\\) symbol) between events. For events \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), the probability of their joint event will be represented with \\(p(e_1 \\cap e_2)\\). The probability of an intersection of events is the same regardless of which event is considered first;\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\label{joint reflexivity} p(e_1 \\cap e_2) = p(e_2 \\cap e_1) \\end{equation}\\] For two events, \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), their intersection is found by; \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{joint probability definition} p(e_1 \\\u0026amp; e_2) = p(e_1\\cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p(e_1|e_2)\\) is a conditional probability, discussed in the next section.\n Conditional Events and Bayes’ Rule Conditional events refer to one event, \\(e_1\\), after another event, \\(e_2\\), is known. \\(p(e_1|e_2)\\) represents the probability of \\(e_1\\) given, or after knowing, \\(e_2\\). These can be defined by rearranging the multiplication rule (equation ) as follows;\n\\[\\begin{equation} p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2)=p(e_1\\cap e_2) \\rightarrow p(e_1|e_2)= \\frac{p(e_1\\cap e_2)}{p(e_2)} \\end{equation}\\] Noting that, by the reflexively of joint events (equation ) and the definition of the multiplication rule (equation ), \\(p(e_1 \\cap e_2) = p(e_2 \\cap e_1)= p(e_2 | e_1) p(e_1)\\), and so the above equation becomes; \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{Bayes Theorem} p(e_1|e_2)=\\frac{p(e_2 | e_1) p(e_1)}{p(e_2)} \\end{equation}\\] Equation is known as Bayes Theorem.\n Unions of Events and the Addition Rule A union (represented with the \\(\\cup\\) symbol) of events refers to at least one of multiple events occurring. For events, \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), their union would include the probability that \\(e_1\\) occurs, the probability that or \\(e_2\\) occurs, and the probability that both \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) occur. Colloquially this is talked about the probability of \\(e_1\\) ‘or’ \\(e_2\\). Formally this is expressed and computed as;\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\label{addition rule} p(e_1\\text{ or } e_2) = p(e_1 \\cup e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1 \\cap e_2) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(p(e_1 \\cap e_2)\\) is a joint probability, defined in Equation .\n Independent Events Independence is a common assumption in many statistical techniques. Statisticians assume independence primarily because it simplifies the computation of certain probabilities. Events are said to be independent if knowing one event does not change the probability of the other event. Formally, if events \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are independent, this would mean that; \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{independent definition} p(e_1|e_2) = p(e_1) \\text{ and } p(e_2|e_1) = p(e_2) \\end{equation}\\] If \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are independent, then their joint probability, defined in in Equation , simplifies as so; \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{product rule with independence} p(e_1 \\cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) = p(e_1)p(e_2) \\end{equation}\\] Where the last equality is only true if \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are independent (i.e. \\(p(e_1|e_2)=p(e_1)\\)).\nThis then simplifies the addition rule in Equation so that; \\[\\begin{equation} p(e_1 \\cup e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1)p(e_2) \\end{equation}\\] Where again, the last part of this equality is only true if \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are independent.\n Mutually Exclusive Events Events \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of either event precludes the occurrence of the other event. Formally mutual exclusivity means that;\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\label{mutually exclusive definition} p(e_1 | e_2) = 0 \\text{ and } p(e_2 | e_1) = 0 \\end{equation}\\] If two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of their joint event is; \\[\\begin{equation} p(e_1 \\cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) = 0*p(e_2) = 0 \\end{equation}\\] And the probability of their union simplifies to; \\[\\begin{equation} p(e_1 \\cup e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1 \\cap e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - 0 = p(e_1) + p(e_2) \\end{equation}\\]   Probability Functions and Parameter Estimation via Likelihoods The general concepts of parameterized probability functions and likelihoods are introduced here. For specific distributions, see Chapter .\nevents can be thought of as values in spaces.. probability functions assign probabilities to data, assuming that parameters are known likelihoods assign probabilities to parameters, assuming the data are known or observed\nDomain of a Function as an Event Space In Section , probabilities were introduced with respect to events. If these events are a value, \\(x\\), from a large set of possible values, \\(X\\), then a probability function, denoted \\(f(x|\\theta)\\), can be used to assign probabilities to the values \\(x \\in X\\).\n PDFs or PMFs, and CDFs Probability functions are referred to as probability density functions (PDFs) if \\(x\\) takes continuous values, and probability mass functions (PMFs) if \\(x\\) takes discrete values. Regardless of the type of variable \\(x\\) is, a probability function that assignes probabilities to values \\(x\\) that depend on a known parameter or parameter vector, \\(\\theta\\), is denoted \\(f(x|\\theta)\\). The cumulative distribution function (CDF), denoted \\(F(x|\\theta)\\), represents the total probability assigned to values of \\(X\\) less than a particular value \\(x\\). The CDF is related to the PDF or PMF through integration from the left side. All of this can be summarized as;\n\\[\\begin{equation} p(X \\leq x |\\theta) = F(x|\\theta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(x|\\theta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x p(X=x|\\theta) \\end{equation}\\] Note that integrals are replaced with summation when \\(x\\) takes discrete values.\nA technical difficulty when considering values in a continuous domain is that the probability of any single value is 0. To sidestep this issue, one can consider values within a tiny set of values around \\(x\\), that is, \\(\\{x:x\\in x\\pm \\Delta\\}\\), for an arbitrarily small \\(\\Delta\\).\nInstead of being based on observations, these assign probabilities to a range of values, \\(x\\), in the domain of the function.\n Likelihood and Log Likelihood The likelihood, denoted \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|x)\\), assigns probabilities to values of a parameter or parameter vector, \\(\\theta\\), when the events or data, \\(x\\) are treated as known. When a number, \\(n\\), of observations are made, and independence between the observations is assumed, the likelihood can be expressed as;\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta | x_1,x_2,...,x_n) = p(\\theta | x_1,x_2,...,x_n) = p(\\theta|x_1) p(\\theta|x_2) ... p(\\theta|x_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p(\\theta|x_i) \\end{equation}\\] Likelihoods can be difficult to work with analytically if they are complicated functions, and numerically if they are very small numbers. Because of this, log likelihoods are often used in place of likelihoods. A log likelihood is defined as;\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\ell(\\theta | x_1,x_2,...,x_n) = log(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta | x_1,x_2,...,x_n)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p(\\theta | x_i) \\end{equation}\\]  Score Function and Fisher Information Usually statisticians are interested in the most likely parameters, that is, the parameter values that maximize the likelihood. One way to find these parameters is to find the derivative of the log likelihood and solve for the parameter values that make this equal to zero. The score function, \\(U(\\theta)\\), is the derivative of the log likelihood. Specifically;\n\\[\\begin{equation} U(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\ell(\\theta| x_1,x_2,...,x_n) \\end{equation}\\] Statisticians are also concerned with the uncertainty in parameter estimates. One statistic used to assess this is Fisher Information, \\(I(\\theta)\\), defined as the negative expectation of the second derivative of the log likelihood;\n\\[\\begin{equation} I(\\theta) = -E\\bigg(\\frac{d^2}{d^2\\theta}\\ell (\\theta | x_1,x_2,...,x_n)\\bigg) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d^2}{d^2\\theta}\\ell (\\theta | x_1,x_2,...,x_n) f(x|\\theta) d\\theta \\end{equation}\\] The inverse Fisher Information, \\(\\frac{1}{I(\\theta)}\\), is the variance of the sampling distribution for parameter estimates obtained by maximizing the log likelihood. As a second derivative, Fisher Information also represents the peakedness of the likelihood around the maximum likelihoods estimate. A large \\(I(\\theta)\\) indicates a steeper peak around the maximum likelihood estimate, which is interpreted as a more informative sample.\n  Information and Entropy see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantities_of_information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory\nSurprise (Self Information) For an event, \\(e\\), surprise (also called information or self-information) is defined to be the function satisfying these properties;\nThe function satisfying these properties is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\label{InformationDfn} I(e)=-log(p(e))=log\\left(\\frac{1}{p(e)} \\right) \\end{equation}\\]  Entropy Entropy is the expected information;\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\label{EntropyDfn} H(E)=E(I(E)) = E(-log(p(E))) = \\int_E p(e)I(e) = -\\int_E p(e)log(p(e)) \\end{equation}\\] entropy is the expected information\n Joint Entropy  Conditional Entropy  Relative Entropy (Divergence) KL divergence\n Mutual Information Mutual information quantifies the information obtained about one random variable through the observation of another. can be expressed as average divergance? self information is a special case of mutual information, the mutual information of a variable and itself. Given the definition of Information in Equation , Mutual Information is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\label{MutualInformationDfn} I(E_1;E_2)=\\int_{E_2} \\int_{E_1} p(e_a,e_2)log\\left(\\frac{p(e_1,e_2)}{p(e_1)p(e_2)} \\right) \\end{equation}\\]   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c6430250197a6347734ff9e5a3bf9c05","permalink":"/MacStrelioff/unlisted/probabilityandinformation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/MacStrelioff/unlisted/probabilityandinformation/","section":"Unlisted","summary":"Probability Theory and Information Theory Types of Probabilities and Their Computations motivation?

As a graduate student in an experimental psychology lab, I wondered if shiny apps could be used to host online experiments. My experiments were essentially simple games – there would be buttons that participants could press, and feedback that they would see based on their actions. I decided to make a rock-paper-scissors app to gain experience with Shiny apps and probe their utility as tools for hosting experiments. You can check out the app here (https://macstrelioff.shinyapps.io/rockpaperscissorsagent/) though I only have 25 hours a month of free hosting, so it may be down occasionally.\nThe source code for this app can be found on my GitHub here\n Shiny apps Shiny apps are primarily a tool for dashboarding. A dashboard is a tool that a data professional could create in order to communicate insights and actionable results to decision-makers. Ideally these apps enable decison-makers to easily interact with the data in a way that streamlines their decision making process. Many examples, with code, can be seen in the shiny app gallary – this was the primary resource I turned to while putting together my app.\nShiny apps are comprised of a user interface (UI) component and a server component; a common layout might look like this;\nlibrary(shiny) ui \u0026lt;- fluidPage() server \u0026lt;- function(input, output){} shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) The ui will contain functions that control the layout of the page and the names of interactive components like buttons and sliders. The server defines how the page changes in response to events and user actions, and the final line shinyApp(ui=ui,server=server) runs the app. For hosting on shinyapps.io (described below), the script that runs the app must be called App.R.\nUI: User Interface My code for the user interface is shown below and broken down in this section;\nui \u0026lt;- fluidPage( # Application title titlePanel(\u0026quot;Rock Paper Scissors!\u0026quot;), # figure fluidRow( column(width=5, plotOutput(\u0026quot;distPlot\u0026quot;) ) ), # buttons fluidRow( column(width=5,offest=2, actionButton(\u0026quot;rock\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Rock\u0026quot;), actionButton(\u0026quot;paper\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Paper\u0026quot;), actionButton(\u0026quot;scissors\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Scissors\u0026quot;) ) ), fluidRow(width=5,offset=5, textOutput(\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;),br(), p(\u0026quot;Source code available at: https://github.com/MacStrelioff/RockPaperScissors\u0026quot;) ) ) The fluidPage() function is named after a type of layout that adjusts to the dimensions of a browser. Functions within fluidPage() add elements to the webpage. titlePanel(\u0026quot;TITLE\u0026quot;) controls the large title at the top of a page. fluidRow() adds rows of elements to the page, the length of which are determined by the column() function. I add the figure with;\ncolumn(width=5, plotOutput(\u0026quot;distPlot\u0026quot;) ) Here plotOutput(\u0026quot;OUTPUT_NAME\u0026quot;) takes an output from the server function, described in the next section, and plots it. More information on reactive output can be found here.\nNext I create the row of buttons with;\n# buttons fluidRow( column(width=5,offest=2, actionButton(\u0026quot;rock\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Rock\u0026quot;), actionButton(\u0026quot;paper\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Paper\u0026quot;), actionButton(\u0026quot;scissors\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Scissors\u0026quot;) ) ) Here offset controls spacing from a previous column call (not used here since everything is in one column() call). Each actionButton() call draws one of the buttons – the first argument is the variable name of this button, which is used as input for the server, and the second argument is the text that appears on the button. An overview of the many kinds of interactive elements you can add is avilable here.\nFinally I add some text to describe game events and point interested users to the source code, with;\nfluidRow(width=5,offset=5, textOutput(\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;),br(), p(\u0026quot;Source code available at: https://github.com/MacStrelioff/RockPaperScissors\u0026quot;) ) Here textOutput(\u0026quot;OUTPUT_NAME\u0026quot;) takes the text ouput variable OUTPUT_NAME from the server and displays it. br(), named after a line break in HTML (\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;) adds a line break. And p() adds static text, again named after a paragraph tag (\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;) in HTML.\n Server The server defines how page elements interact with user input and server events.\nComponents My code for the server is shown below and broken down in this section with an emphasis on the functions used. In the code below, I replaced opponent logic with ... to keep the emphasis here on understanding server functions. This logic is revealed and detailed in the next section.\nserver \u0026lt;- function(input, output) { # initialize variables (runs once when app visited) values \u0026lt;- reactiveValues() values$round =0; # track round values$opp_actions = c() # track opponent actions values$score =0; # track score values$scores=0; # track score history for feedback values$grams = data.frame(\u0026#39;rrrrr\u0026#39;=rep(0,3)) # initialize to store gram counts values$a = \u0026quot;init\u0026quot;; values$as = c(\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;) # possible actions observeEvent(input$rock | input$paper | input$scissors,{ # if any action taken (done to block the first run when these are all NULL-\u0026gt;0) if(input$rock | input$paper | input$scissors){ # increment round values$round = values$round+1; # policy -- code to greedily pick best action ## if fewer than 5 actions taken, draw uniformly if(length(values$opp_actions)\u0026lt;5){ values$a=sample(values$as,1) } else{ # if at least 5 actions taken nobs = length(values$opp_actions) ngram = paste(values$opp_actions[(nobs-4):nobs],collapse = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) #cat(\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;,ngram) # if this pattern not observed before, initialize it and choose randomly if(!any(names(values$grams)==ngram)){ values$grams[ngram]=rep(0,3) values$a=sample(values$as,1) } else { # if at least 5 actions taken, and this pattern has been seen before, pred = values$as[which.max(values$grams[ngram][[1]])] values$a=switch(pred,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;) } #cat(\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;,names(values$grams)) #cat(\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;,values$grams[ngram][[1]]) } # get opponent action and outcome if(input$rock -sum(values$opp_actions==\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;)==1){ opp_action=\u0026quot;r\u0026quot; dscore = switch(values$a,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=0,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=-1,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=1) } if(input$paper -sum(values$opp_actions==\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;)==1){ opp_action=\u0026quot;p\u0026quot; dscore = switch(values$a,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=1,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=0,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=-1) } if(input$scissors-sum(values$opp_actions==\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;)==1){ opp_action=\u0026quot;s\u0026quot; dscore = switch(values$a,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=-1,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=1,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=0) } # evaluate outcome values$score = values$score+dscore values$scores = c(values$scores,values$score); # update opponent model values$opp_actions = c(values$opp_actions,opp_action); if(length(values$opp_actions)\u0026gt;5){ if(any(names(values$grams)==ngram)){ values$grams[ngram][[1]]=values$grams[ngram][[1]]+(values$as==opp_action) } } } # use strings to code, then just take last 5 strings and use as the key for the dictionary of 5-grams... output$distPlot \u0026lt;- renderPlot({ try({ x = seq(0,values$round); y = values$scores; cat(\u0026quot;\\n round:\u0026quot;,values$round, \u0026quot;, score:\u0026quot;,values$score,\u0026quot;, len(x): \u0026quot;,length(x),\u0026quot; len(y):\u0026quot;,length(y),\u0026quot;, opp_act:\u0026quot;,values$opp_actions, \u0026quot;\\n a: \u0026quot;,values$a, sep=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins plot(x,y,type=\u0026quot;l\u0026quot;,xlab = \u0026quot;Rounds\u0026quot;,ylab=\u0026quot;Score\u0026quot;,main=\u0026quot;Cumulative Score\u0026quot;) }) }) }) output$result = renderText({ paste(\u0026quot;Opponent chose: \u0026quot;,switch(values$a,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;Rock\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;Paper\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;Scissors\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;init\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;Nothing yet, ...\u0026quot;)) }) } The first chunk here, shown below, uses the reactiveValues() function to create a named list of variables that can be updated throughout the app session.\n# initialize variables (runs once when app visited) values \u0026lt;- reactiveValues() values$round =0; # track round values$opp_actions = c() # track opponent actions values$score =0; # track score values$scores=0; # track score history for feedback values$grams = data.frame(\u0026#39;rrrrr\u0026#39;=rep(0,3)) # initialize to store gram counts values$a = \u0026quot;init\u0026quot;; values$as = c(\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;) # possible actions The next section uses observeEvent(LOGICAL) to check if an event has occurred. Here the events are a TRUE value from any of the buttons, which would represent that the button had been pressed. The variables input$NAME represent the button whose label is NAME. The second argument is a script to run when an event is detected. Note that the values for variables that reflect button presses, here input$rock, input$paper, input$scissors, are initialized as NULL, so the server will first run once with these values as NULL. To avoid the game from starting on this run, I included a conditional that required one of their values to be TRUE, which would indicate that the player clicked one of the buttons. The rest of this block is replaced with ... because it is game logic that is described below, however, it heavily relies on access to the reactive values stored in the values structure.\n observeEvent(input$rock | input$paper | input$scissors,{ # if any action taken (done to block the first run when these are all NULL-\u0026gt;0) if(input$rock | input$paper | input$scissors){ ... } } The last two chunks use the renderPlot() function to produce the distPlot variable, stored in the output structure, which is referenced in the ui when drawing the figure. This code occasionally crashed when button presses happened rapidly, so I wrapped it in a try() block. The cat() function was used to print values to the console while debugging. Finally, I used the renderText() function to assign textual feedback on the agent’s actions to the output variable result which is referenced in the ui when displaying the text that is rendered here.\noutput$distPlot \u0026lt;- renderPlot({ try({ x = seq(0,values$round); y = values$scores; cat(\u0026quot;\\n round:\u0026quot;,values$round, \u0026quot;, score:\u0026quot;,values$score,\u0026quot;, len(x): \u0026quot;,length(x),\u0026quot; len(y):\u0026quot;,length(y),\u0026quot;, opp_act:\u0026quot;,values$opp_actions, \u0026quot;\\n a: \u0026quot;,values$a, sep=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins plot(x,y,type=\u0026quot;l\u0026quot;,xlab = \u0026quot;Rounds\u0026quot;,ylab=\u0026quot;Score\u0026quot;,main=\u0026quot;Cumulative Score\u0026quot;) }) }) }) output$result = renderText({ paste(\u0026quot;Opponent chose: \u0026quot;,switch(values$a,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;Rock\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;Paper\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;Scissors\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;init\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;Nothing yet, ...\u0026quot;)) })  Rock Paper Scissors Agent Logic Here I return to the logic inside the observeEvent() call that implements the game. This code is run whenever a user chooses an action. First I increment the round, which is stored in the reactiveValue structure, values;\n# increment round values$round = values$round+1; I then implemented the agent’s policy. In a reinforcement learning context, a policy is an agent’s probability distribution over actions. The actions here are stored in the reactive value as which consists of “r”,“p”, and “s”, respectively representing the actions Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The policy I implemented here depends on the last 5 actions that a user takes. The entire history of a user’s actions, excluding the current action, is stored in the reactive value opp_actions which is a string consisting of the charasters “r”, “p”, or “s”. For example, if opp_actions is “rrps”, it would mean that the user chose rock twice, then paper, then scissors, before picking the current action which is not yet part of the action history. The agent’s action is stored in the reactive value a. On the first 5 rounds, the agent picks uniformly from the actions Rock, Paper, Scissors;\nif(length(values$opp_actions)\u0026lt;5){ values$a=sample(values$as,1) }  After 5 rounds, the agent uses 5-grams (sequences of the last 5 user actions), to pick an action that will beat the most likely player action based on the previous times the player has emitted this sequence of 5 actions. To implement this, I first get the number of observed actions, nobs, and then get a string that represents the last 5 actions the user has taken, ngram. If theis sequence has not been observed, the agent creates an instance of the sequence in its memory of the users’s 5-grams (grams), initializes counts of the uses subsequent Rock, Paper, Scissors actions to 0, and finally uniformly samples an action. Otherwise, if this sequence has been observed before, the agent predicts what the user will choose on this round (pred) by finding the action that the player most frequently chose in the past after an identical sequence of 5 actions, and then picks the action a that would beat what it expects the player to chose. The code that implements this process is shown below;\n else{ # if at least 5 actions taken nobs = length(values$opp_actions) ngram = paste(values$opp_actions[(nobs-4):nobs],collapse = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # if this pattern not observed before, initialize it and choose randomly if(!any(names(values$grams)==ngram)){ values$grams[ngram]=rep(0,3) values$a=sample(values$as,1) } else { # if at least 5 actions taken, and this pattern has been seen before, pred = values$as[which.max(values$grams[ngram][[1]])] values$a=switch(pred,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;) } #cat(\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;,names(values$grams)) #cat(\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;,values$grams[ngram][[1]]) } The game environment then processes the user’s action and the agent’s action, and determines an outcome of +1 if the user won, 0 if the agent and user tied, and -1 if the agent won;\n# get opponent action and outcome if(input$rock -sum(values$opp_actions==\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;)==1){ opp_action=\u0026quot;r\u0026quot; dscore = switch(values$a,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=0,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=-1,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=1) } if(input$paper -sum(values$opp_actions==\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;)==1){ opp_action=\u0026quot;p\u0026quot; dscore = switch(values$a,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=1,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=0,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=-1) } if(input$scissors-sum(values$opp_actions==\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;)==1){ opp_action=\u0026quot;s\u0026quot; dscore = switch(values$a,\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;=-1,\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;=1,\u0026quot;s\u0026quot;=0) } The outcome value is added to the cumulative score, score, and the score is appended to the scores variables which stores the score on every round for plotting.\n# evaluate outcome values$score = values$score+dscore values$scores = c(values$scores,values$score); Finally, the agent updates its model of the user by appending the current action to the user’s action history, opp_actions, and updating it’s memory of user behavior stored in grams by incrementing the count of the user’s action associated with the 5-gram for this round, ngram.\n# update opponent model values$opp_actions = c(values$opp_actions,opp_action); if(length(values$opp_actions)\u0026gt;5){ if(any(names(values$grams)==ngram)){ values$grams[ngram][[1]]=values$grams[ngram][[1]]+(values$as==opp_action) }   Hosting Hosting locally Running the function shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) from RStudio will run the application on a local host. This is great for debugging, but not great for making the app avilable to users on other computers.\n Hosting online RStudio supports many ways of hosting a shiny app, but the one that worked best for me was to host through the free plan at Shinnyapps.io. A detailed walkthrough on deploying shiny apps can be found here.\nIt is also possible to host a Shiny app through Amazon Web Services.
