      <description>--- Working Environment My working environment relies on bash and git. Here I provide some background on these tools and a walkthrough for automatic, scheduled pushes to git.
Working With Bash and Git Useful Bash Commands login # prompts for username and then password to log in man # man (command) returns documentation a command  Directory Commands pwd # print working directory cd # changes directory to home cd \ # changes directory to (/path) cd .</description>
