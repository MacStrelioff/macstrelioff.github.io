Who?
I recently finished a PhD

-->

I’m personally interested optimizing knowledge generation and decision making processes. This lead me to study psychology and statistics, where I designed experiments and developed statistical methods to model human decision making and infer a person's decision making strategy from their choices.

I am also passionate about breaking down barriers by democratizing education. Along these lines, I maintain a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8KypaF6w6K0SO6KLvyst8w) that began as videos of my lessons that I recorded for students who couldn't attend lectures. 

Finally, I enjoy diving into new areas and learning new tools through consulting work and [hobby projects](https://macstrelioff.github.io/MacStrelioff/data-science/).

<!--
This is exemplified through two recent experiences. First, through a consulting project with a startup where I developed a model to predict which trial users would fail to convert to paying customers so that my client could intervene with these users. Second, through a current freelance project with a startup where I am using \textbf{Google Analytics} and Facebook Ad Analytics to devise ads and experiments that will facilitate growth.

<!--
These themes pervaded my graduate work in experimental psychology, where I studied the strategies that people use when converting information from their environments into reward-maximizing actions. 
-->

<!--
This lead me to pursue a PhD in an Experimental Psychology lab and a concurrent MS in Statistics. I conducted severl lines of research during graduate school around themes of decision making, strategy inference, and effects of individual biases on aggregate metrics.

% Introduction
My name is Mac Strelioff. I am a recent graduate with a PhD from an experimental psychology lab and a concurrent MS in Statistics. I am excited to be applying for the Data Scientist role at Magoosh. 

% Personal connection to mission / values / culture
Throughout my college career, I have relied heavily on accessible learning materials. This garnished a personal understanding of the importance of such materials and a passion for producing accessible material for others. For example, while I was a Teaching Assistant I took initiative to record my lessons and post them on YouTube for my students who couldn't attend lectures. Recently, I have been focusing on metrics like video watch time to guide decisions about new content that I make.

% Technical fit
Beyond my passion for accessible learning materials, my years of experience with statistical methodologies applied to human behavior make me an ideal fit for the technical tasks of a Data Scientist at Magoosh. I conducted several lines of research during my PhD, three of which are highly relevant to the current role. First, my primary research involved developing machine learning models that emulated the way people learn a new motor skill in response to feedback. Second, I developed a model to infer which decision-making strategy a person was following on each trial of a gambling task. \textbf{These first two projects demonstrate my ability to use customized statistical methodologies to deepen an understanding of human behavior in gamified learning and decision making contexts}. My third line of research involved analyzing a large dataset of transactions in a prediction market to discover market-level mispricing consistent with established individual-level biases in probabilistic reasoning. 

% more culture + relevant experience
I also enjoy diving into new areas and learning new tools through consulting and freelance work. This is exemplified through two recent experiences. First, through a consulting project with a startup where I developed a model to predict which trial users would fail to convert to paying customers so that my client could intervene with these users. Second, through a current freelance project with a startup where I am using \textbf{Google Analytics} and Facebook Ad Analytics to devise ads and experiments that will facilitate growth.

Overall I am excited by the learning culture at Magoosh and the potential for impact through improving accessible educational materials. 

I look forward to hearing from you if you feel I would be a good addition to the team!

TODO:

- Update website:
- - Change bio and project descriptions to answer common interview questions 'tell me about yourself, why DS, ...'
- - Change bio page to be product focused
- - Refine DS fundamentals pages
- - Add video presentations of my work, and a video 'about me'

- 1 LI message a day
- - Elena Grewal, Ph.D., Head of Data Science at Airbnb (We're hiring!)

- 1 job application a day

- 1 DS video every 3 days
- - Google question one
- - About me (landing page on my channel)
- - Project descriptions
- - What is probability, really??
- - What is a probability mass function?
- - Behavioral questions (use general titles for these to attract a large audience)
- - How I Get Free Bitcoin With This Simple Python Script (And You Can Too!)

- DS Projects for my GitHub:
- - Intent modeling of AirBnb users, based on Pintrest intent modeling paper, but using an online model that updates the probability that a user is planning to book or not book, and infers where they are planning to book :D
- - - naieve bayes, or knn to get distributions of behavior, and maybe distributions of behavior conditional on previous behaviors (behavior transitions) for each class -- then use these to update probability of belonging to a class. 
- - Instacart, a item utility over time model applied to instacart data!
- - - so, model an increasing preference from a user for an item, based on 
- - - could help improve recommendations or target ads
- - - generatively, related to items being depleated or craved periodically
- - maybe intent modeling for the airbnb dataset?

- Causal Inference:
- - illness treatment, symptom, condition: https://www.kaggle.com/flaredown/flaredown-autoimmune-symptom-tracker/kernels
- - RTB paper collection: https://github.com/wnzhang/rtb-papers

- Programming:
- - Kaggle tutorials (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
- - Cracking the Coding Interview, put solutions on GitHub, walkthrough on YouTube
- - something on quantopian? Work through their python tutorials?
