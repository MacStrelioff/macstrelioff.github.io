Who?
I recently finished a PhD

-->


I’ve always been curious about people’s decision making processes and personally interested in making the best decisions possible. This lead me to pursue a PhD in a computational neuroscience lab where I used bandit tasks and reinforcement learning models to understand human decision making and infer strategies from observed choices.

<!--
% Introduction
My name is Mac Strelioff. I am a recent graduate with a PhD from an experimental psychology lab and a concurrent MS in Statistics. I am excited to be applying for the Data Scientist role at Magoosh. 

% Personal connection to mission / values / culture
Throughout my college career, I have relied heavily on accessible learning materials. This garnished a personal understanding of the importance of such materials and a passion for producing accessible material for others. For example, while I was a Teaching Assistant I took initiative to record my lessons and post them on YouTube for my students who couldn't attend lectures. Recently, I have been focusing on metrics like video watch time to guide decisions about new content that I make.

% Technical fit
Beyond my passion for accessible learning materials, my years of experience with statistical methodologies applied to human behavior make me an ideal fit for the technical tasks of a Data Scientist at Magoosh. I conducted several lines of research during my PhD, three of which are highly relevant to the current role. First, my primary research involved developing machine learning models that emulated the way people learn a new motor skill in response to feedback. Second, I developed a model to infer which decision-making strategy a person was following on each trial of a gambling task. \textbf{These first two projects demonstrate my ability to use customized statistical methodologies to deepen an understanding of human behavior in gamified learning and decision making contexts}. My third line of research involved analyzing a large dataset of transactions in a prediction market to discover market-level mispricing consistent with established individual-level biases in probabilistic reasoning. 

% more culture + relevant experience
I also enjoy diving into new areas and learning new tools through consulting and freelance work. This is exemplified through two recent experiences. First, through a consulting project with a startup where I developed a model to predict which trial users would fail to convert to paying customers so that my client could intervene with these users. Second, through a current freelance project with a startup where I am using \textbf{Google Analytics} and Facebook Ad Analytics to devise ads and experiments that will facilitate growth.

Overall I am excited by the learning culture at Magoosh and the potential for impact through improving accessible educational materials. 

I look forward to hearing from you if you feel I would be a good addition to the team!

TODO:

- Update website:
- - Change bio and project descriptions to answer common interview questions 'tell me about yourself, why DS, ...'
- - Change bio page to be product focused
- - Refine DS fundamentals pages
- - Add video presentations of my work, and a video 'about me'

- 1 LI message a day
- - Elena Grewal, Ph.D., Head of Data Science at Airbnb (We're hiring!)

- 1 job application a day

- 1 DS video every 3 days
- - Google question one
- - About me (landing page on my channel)
- - Project descriptions
- - What is probability, really??
- - What is a probability mass function?
- - Behavioral questions (use general titles for these to attract a large audience)
- - How I Get Free Bitcoin With This Simple Python Script (And You Can Too!)

- DS Projects for my GitHub:
- - Intent modeling of AirBnb users, based on Pintrest intent modeling paper, but using an online model that updates the probability that a user is planning to book or not book, and infers where they are planning to book :D
- - - naieve bayes, or knn to get distributions of behavior, and maybe distributions of behavior conditional on previous behaviors (behavior transitions) for each class -- then use these to update probability of belonging to a class. 
- - Instacart, a item utility over time model applied to instacart data!
- - - so, model an increasing preference from a user for an item, based on 
- - - could help improve recommendations or target ads
- - - generatively, related to items being depleated or craved periodically
- - maybe intent modeling for the airbnb dataset?

- Causal Inference:
- - illness treatment, symptom, condition: https://www.kaggle.com/flaredown/flaredown-autoimmune-symptom-tracker/kernels
- - RTB paper collection: https://github.com/wnzhang/rtb-papers

- Programming:
- - Kaggle tutorials (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
- - Cracking the Coding Interview, put solutions on GitHub, walkthrough on YouTube
- - something on quantopian? Work through their python tutorials?
