<!-- Work goals and interests -->
Iâ€™m interested in optimizing discovery and decision making processes. This lead me to pursue a PhD in an Experimental Psychology lab and a concurrent MS in Statistics. In graduate school, I designed experiments to investigate how context and feedback influence subsequent choices and developed statistical models to emulate and infer a person's decision making strategy.

<!-- Interesting passion -->
I am personally passionate about breaking down barriers by democratizing education. Along these lines, I maintain a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8KypaF6w6K0SO6KLvyst8w) that began as recordings of my lessons for students who couldn't attend lectures. 

<!-- more interesting passion -->
I also enjoy diving into new areas and learning new tools through consulting work and [hobby projects](https://macstrelioff.github.io/MacStrelioff/data-science/). 
<!-- call to action -->
I am constantly looking for new ways to apply my skills -- Feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/macstrelioff/) if you have any opportunities!

TODO:

- Work for HaaS / Peter
- Apply to Stripe (https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1404767563/)
- Apply to Instacart
- Prepare for Wealthfront
- - Brush up on hypothesis testing / things for technical phone screen
- - Learn about attribution models for Stripe and Wealthfront
- - maybe start here: https://agencyanalytics.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models


- Update website:
- - "Cracking the coding interview" Ch V to update project bios on webpage
- - Change bio as to not pidgeonhole myself? 
- - Change project descriptions to answer common interview questions 'tell me about X project'
- - Change bio page to be product focused
- - Refine DS fundamentals pages
- - Add video presentations of my work, and a video 'about me'

- 1 LI message a day
- - Elena Grewal, Ph.D., Head of Data Science at Airbnb (We're hiring!)

- 1 job application a day

- 1 DS video every 3 days
- - Google question one
- - About me (landing page on my channel)
- - Project descriptions
- - What is probability, really??
- - What is a probability mass function?
- - Behavioral questions (use general titles for these to attract a large audience)
- - How I Get Free Bitcoin With This Simple Python Script (And You Can Too!)

- DS Projects for my GitHub:
- - Intent modeling of AirBnb users, based on Pintrest intent modeling paper, but using an online model that updates the probability that a user is planning to book or not book, and infers where they are planning to book :D
- - - naieve bayes, or knn to get distributions of behavior, and maybe distributions of behavior conditional on previous behaviors (behavior transitions) for each class -- then use these to update probability of belonging to a class. 
- - Instacart, a item utility over time model applied to instacart data!
- - - so, model an increasing preference from a user for an item, based on 
- - - could help improve recommendations or target ads
- - - generatively, related to items being depleated or craved periodically
- - maybe intent modeling for the airbnb dataset?

- Causal Inference:
- - illness treatment, symptom, condition: https://www.kaggle.com/flaredown/flaredown-autoimmune-symptom-tracker/kernels
- - RTB paper collection: https://github.com/wnzhang/rtb-papers

- Programming:
- - Kaggle tutorials (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
- - Cracking the Coding Interview, put solutions on GitHub, walkthrough on YouTube
- - something on quantopian? Work through their python tutorials?
