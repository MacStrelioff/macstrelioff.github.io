I'm interested in understanding the things people do. This lead me to focus on decision making through my undergraduate course work, and to draw on ideas from statistics and machine learning to build models of human learning during my dissertation work. I had a lot of fun thinking deeply about the models and underlying structure behind peopleâ€™s actions, and would like to employ this line of thinking to build products that people love.
