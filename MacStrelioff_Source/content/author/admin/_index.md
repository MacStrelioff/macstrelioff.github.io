<!--
Who?
I recently finished a PhD

-->



I’ve always been curious about people’s decision making processes and personally interested in making the best decisions possible. This lead me to pursue a PhD in a computational neuroscience lab where I used bandit tasks and reinforcement learning models to understand human decision making and infer strategies from observed choices.
