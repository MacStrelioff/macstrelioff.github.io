<!-- Work goals and interests -->
Iâ€™m interested in optimizing discovery and decision making processes. This lead me to pursue a PhD in an Experimental Psychology lab and a concurrent MS in Statistics. In graduate school, I designed experiments to investigate how context and feedback influence subsequent choices and developed statistical models to emulate and infer a person's decision making strategy.

<!-- more interesting passion -->
I also enjoy diving into new areas and learning new tools through consulting work and [hobby projects](https://macstrelioff.github.io/MacStrelioff/data-science/). 
<!-- call to action -->
I am constantly looking for new ways to apply my skills -- Feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/macstrelioff/) if you have any opportunities!

<!-- Interesting passion -->
<!-- I am personally passionate about breaking down barriers by democratizing education. Along these lines, I maintain a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8KypaF6w6K0SO6KLvyst8w) that began as recordings of my lessons for students who couldn't attend lectures.

old LI blurb
Experienced researcher with graduate degrees in cognitive science and statistics, and deep experience with: Bayesian modeling, decision theory, experimentation, machine learning. I'm primarily interested in experimentation and developing machine learning methods to automate real time decision making.

<!-- AIRBNB COVER LETTER
Dear Hiring Team,

Airbnb has helped me broaden my perspective and expand my professional network through numerous experiences. Ironically, many of the experiences Airbnb has afforded me have helped me develop the skills that I hope to bring to the table as a Data Scientist at Airbnb.

In the summer of 2017 I stayed in London to present evidence of anomalies in prediction market prices that were predicted by behavioral economic theory. Through Airbnb, I subsequently stayed in Amsterdam for a workshop on advanced Bayesian statistics followed by a vacation in Venice with a close friend and brilliant collaborator. 

In 2018, Airbnb enabled me to stay in a homely loft with an amazing host in Mexico City during a small collaborative meeting at The National Autonomous University of Mexico. While there, I presented work using Bayesian inference and advanced cognitive models to understand how people and animals adapt their behavior to maximize rewards under complex incentive structures. 

After graduating from UC Irvine in May of 2019 with a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and a M.S. in Statistics, Airbnb made it easy to find lodging in San Francisco during a data science bootcamp. While in San Francisco, I consulted with a Bay Area startup to help them understand their user demographic and to develop a machine learning model to predict which users on a free-trial would convert to paying customers. Most recently I've been working with another San Francisco startup to develop effective ads. 

Overall I cherish the experiences that were affordable through Airbnb, and I look forward to an opportunity to apply my skills to an organization that facilitates life changing experiences for millions of people.

I look forward to hearing from you if you feel I would be a good addition to the team! 

Best Wishes, 
Mac Strelioff

Pintrest
- Python, data munging, pandas
- SQL care about efficency (e.g. reduce data before joining)
- probability questions; 
- - CTR of x, what's p(5 out of n click through)
- - fundamental probability
- business case; open case study..

Bandit + CI

propensity score is the probability of being assigned to treatment or control based on covariates, and IV analysis with ITT and ATT can rescale an oberved treatment effect to account for the proportion of people treated.. Can these methods be used to obtain better estimates of an effect in a bandit context? A bandit changes the probability of assignment (so can the policy be used like a propensity score?)

TODO:

- Instacart Prep
- - Practice product questions: think of opportunities to talk about metrics, causal inference, and hypothesis testing
- - look at video and think of metrics they might have
- - Blurbs about each of my projects, and how they add value to instacart
- - Read instacart blogs, strategies for different possible questions
- - Product and experimentation videos
- - SQL


- Work for HaaS / Peter
- Thompson sampling blog post
- PredictIt trading dashboard
- AWS or other cloud platform for scraping, storing data?

- YT video on CI based on LinkedIn question
- Effectiveness of a job ad that wasn't randomly shown to users 
- - targeted assignment violates the nonconfoundedness accumption of causal inference
- - one method to solve this is propensity score matching
- Roll out a new version of an app 
- - Diff in diff if parallel trends is assumed
- - otherwise something to estimate a counterfactual group - synthetic controls, or Google's causal impact

- YT 'about me' video to post on my LinkedIn summary
- YT 'my projects' video for similar reason

- Blog
- Causal inference blog on the effect of debates on market prices in PI
- - diff in diff doesn't make sense
- - can't use synthetic control because there aren't other groups (could maybe use polls?)
- - Google's CI package (in R). 
- Prepare for Wealthfront
- - Brush up on hypothesis testing / things for technical phone screen
- - Learn about attribution models for Stripe and Wealthfront
- - maybe start here: https://agencyanalytics.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models

- Update website:
- - "Cracking the coding interview" Ch V to update project bios on webpage
- - Change bio as to not pidgeonhole myself? 
- - Change project descriptions to answer common interview questions 'tell me about X project'
- - Change bio page to be product focused
- - Refine DS fundamentals pages
- - Add video presentations of my work, and a video 'about me'

- 1 LI message a day
- - Elena Grewal, Ph.D., Head of Data Science at Airbnb (We're hiring!)

- 1 job application a day

- 1 DS video every 3 days
- - Google question one
- - About me (landing page on my channel)
- - Project descriptions
- - What is probability, really??
- - What is a probability mass function?
- - Behavioral questions (use general titles for these to attract a large audience)
- - How I Get Free Bitcoin With This Simple Python Script (And You Can Too!)

- DS Projects for my GitHub:
- - Intent modeling of AirBnb users, based on Pintrest intent modeling paper, but using an online model that updates the probability that a user is planning to book or not book, and infers where they are planning to book :D
- - - naieve bayes, or knn to get distributions of behavior, and maybe distributions of behavior conditional on previous behaviors (behavior transitions) for each class -- then use these to update probability of belonging to a class. 
- - Instacart, a item utility over time model applied to instacart data!
- - - so, model an increasing preference from a user for an item, based on 
- - - could help improve recommendations or target ads
- - - generatively, related to items being depleated or craved periodically
- - maybe intent modeling for the airbnb dataset?

- Causal Inference:
- - illness treatment, symptom, condition: https://www.kaggle.com/flaredown/flaredown-autoimmune-symptom-tracker/kernels
- - RTB paper collection: https://github.com/wnzhang/rtb-papers

- Programming:
- - Kaggle tutorials (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
