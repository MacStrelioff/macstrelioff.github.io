The parent folder may be renamed, for example, to `docs` for project documentation or `course` for creating an online course.

To disable this feature, either delete the parent folder, or set `draft = true` in the front matter of all its pages. 

After renaming or deleting the parent folder, you may wish to update any `[[menu.main]]` menu links to it in the `config.toml`.
