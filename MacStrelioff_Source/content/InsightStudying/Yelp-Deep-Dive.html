<div id="current-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Current issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trust, businesses can game Yelp by <a href="https://thehustle.co/botto-bistro-1-star-yelp/">asking for low ratings</a>,</li>
<li>Trust, Businesses accuse Yelp of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/court-rules-yelp-can-manipulate-reviews-2014-9">maliciously manipulating reviews</a>, to such an extent that, in response to a documentary about this, Yelp redirected BillionDollerBully.com to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/extortion">this response</a>.</li>
<li>Influence: “Such ubiquity has consequences. A study from last year found that a measly half-star difference made it 19% more likely that a San Francisco restaurant would be busy at peak times.” - <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sandraeallen/is-yelp-evil-or-just-misunderstood">this post</a></li>
<li>Lack of expected growth: “He cited a lack of growth from several of the site’s advertising efforts for his downgrade, as well as a lack of “consequential” new products “to reduce churn or drive revenue.” <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-the-democratic-debates-mean-for-health-care-investors-51564665029">this post</a></li>
<li>Balancing review usefulness, reliability, and legitimacy -</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="competitors" class="section level3">
<h3>Competitors</h3>
<ul>
<li>“On one extreme, Angie’s List features reviews of local products and services provided by and visible to its fee-paying members. On the other, Urbanspoon and CitySearch, Tripadvisor, and Amazon don’t really scrutinize reviewers or reviews.” - <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sandraeallen/is-yelp-evil-or-just-misunderstood">this post</a></li>
<li>Full paragraph: “For better and for worse, strangers’ opinions affect our purchasing behavior to an unprecedented degree. Such feedback, of course, is easily corrupted. Websites like Yelp face the problem of whether and how to scrutinize the data they receive to ensure reliability. On one extreme, Angie’s List features reviews of local products and services provided by and visible to its fee-paying members. On the other, Urbanspoon and CitySearch, Tripadvisor, and Amazon don’t really scrutinize reviewers or reviews. While more democratic, they’re also much more susceptible to manipulation and therefore theoretically less useful to consumers. If a business owner or her friend or someone she pays can pose as a happy customer — or sabotage her competition — a review is no more useful than an ad.”</li>
</ul>

<div id="ideas-and-excitement" class="section level3">
<h3>Ideas and excitement</h3>
<ul>
<li>I like that they have <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/2015/06/data-science-challenge-predict-restaurant-health-scores-with-yelp-data">data challenges</a></li>
<li>I like their openness with data, particularly the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=yelp">datasets on Kaggle</a></li>
<li></li>
<li>check for predictive relationship between reservations or delivery orders made in a quarter, and a conglomerate’s or restaurant’s revenue for that quarter?</li>
<li>Since a restaurant’s revenue is basically customers * customer value, if Yelp reservations is a good proxy for number of customers, then it might also be a good proxy for quarterly revenue.</li>
</ul>
