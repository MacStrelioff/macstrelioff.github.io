# What is a probability, and how does that relate to statistics? 

- Probabilities are commonly thought of in three ways; 

1. Purely mathematical
2. Magnitudes of belief
3. Relative frequencies of infinate events

I use probability theory to quantify beliefs and make decisions. 

Logic, about truths of the universe. 
By there is uncertainty in what we know, and uncertainty in our measurements and observations. Statistics as a field is concerned with specifying our knowledge of the laws of the universe and the uncertainty around them. They do this by applying probability theory. 

Probability theory generalizes logic to situations where we aren't certain. And logic emerges from probability theory when we know things with certainty. 

Hypothesis testing

Statisticians use probability theory to decide on what is and isn't true

# Events and Random Variables

Events, event spaces, 

combinatorics (permutations and combinations)

A random variable random variable is a variable with an unknown value, but known possible values. An event is an observed value of a random variable. An event space contains all possible values of the random variable. Probabilities are values assigned to the events in an event space (i.e. the possible values of a random variable) and represent how likely each event is relative to other events in the event space.

Here $p(e)$ will be used to represent the probability of an event. Some special probabilities include the probability of any event in the event space, which is 1. And the probability of any event other than $p(e)$, known as the compliment of $p(e)$, denoted with $p(\neg e)$, is found by; 

$$
p(\neg e) = 1 - p(e)
$$

## Probability Rules

A joint event refers to two or more events occurring together. They are colloquially talked about as one event 'and' another event occurring together. More formally, joint events are called intersections (represented with the $\cap$ symbol) between events. For events $e_1$ and $e_2$, the probability of their joint event will be represented with $p(e_1 \cap e_2)$. The probability of an intersection of events is the same regardless of which event is considered first; 

$$
p(e_1 \cap e_2) = p(e_2 \cap e_1)
$$

For two events, $e_1$ and $e_2$, their intersection is found by;
$$
p(e_1 \& e_2) = p(e_1\cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2)
$$
where $p(e_1|e_2)$ is a conditional probability, discussed in the next section. 


Conditional events refer to one event, $e_1$, after another event, $e_2$, is known. $p(e_1|e_2)$ represents the probability of $e_1$ given, or after knowing, $e_2$. These can be defined by rearranging the multiplication rule as follows; 
$$
p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2)=p(e_1\cap e_2) \Rightarrow p(e_1|e_2)= \frac{p(e_1\cap e_2)}{p(e_2)}
$$

Noting that, by the reflexively of joint events and the definition of the multiplication rule, $p(e_1 \cap e_2) = p(e_2 \cap e_1)= p(e_2 | e_1) p(e_1)$, and so the above equation becomes; 
$$
p(e_1|e_2)=\frac{p(e_2 | e_1) p(e_1)}{p(e_2)}
$$
This equation is known as Bayes' Theorem or Bayes' Rule.

A union (represented with the $\cup$ symbol) of events refers to at least one of multiple events occurring. For events, $e_1$ and $e_2$, their union would include the probability that $e_1$ occurs, the probability that or $e_2$ occurs, and the probability that both $e_1$ and $e_2$ occur. Colloquially this is talked about the probability of $e_1$ 'or' $e_2$. Formally this is expressed and computed as; 
$$
p(e_1\text{ or } e_2) = p(e_1 \cup e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1 \cap e_2)
$$

Where $p(e_1 \cap e_2)$ is a joint probability.

Independence is a common assumption in many statistical techniques. Statisticians assume independence primarily because it simplifies the computation of certain probabilities. Events are said to be independent if knowing one event does not change the probability of the other event. Formally, if events $e_1$ and $e_2$ are independent, this would mean that; 
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(e_1|e_2) &= p(e_1) \\
p(e_2|e_1) &= p(e_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

If $e_1$ and $e_2$ are independent, then their joint probability simplifies as so; 
$$
p(e_1 \cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) = p(e_1)p(e_2)
$$
Where the last equality is only true if $e_1$ and $e_2$ are independent (i.e. $p(e_1|e_2)=p(e_1)$). 

Then the probability of their union simplifies to;
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(e_1 \cup e_2) &= p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) \\
&= p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1)p(e_2)
\end{aligned}
$$
Where again, the last part of this equality is only true if $e_1$ and $e_2$ are independent.

Events $e_1$ and $e_2$ are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of either event precludes the occurrence of the other event. Formally mutual exclusivity means that; 
$$
p(e_1 | e_2) = 0 \text{ and } p(e_2 | e_1) = 0
$$

If two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of their joint event is; 
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(e_1 \cap e_2) &= p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) \\
&= 0*p(e_2) \\
&= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

And the probability of their union simplifies to;
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(e_1 \cup e_2) &= p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1 \cap e_2) \\
&= p(e_1) + p(e_2) - 0 \\
&=p(e_1) + p(e_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Probability Functions

<!--
Many machine learning algorithms are different ways of estimating f(x)
-->

Here I'll describe the properties and use cases for probability functions and cumulative probability functions. Conventionally, use $f(x)$ is used represent a probability function, and $F(x)$ to represent a cumulative probability function. $f(x)$ is commonly called a probability mass function (pmf) if $x$ is discrete, and a probability density function (pdf) if $x$ is continuous. $f(x)$ and $F(x)$ are related through integration: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= \frac{d}{dx}F(x) \\
F(x) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx
\end{aligned}
$$

For discrete variables, the probability function represents the probability that $X$ takes a specific value $x$: $f(x) = p(X=x)$. For continuous variables, the probability that the variable $X$ takes any particular value is technically $0$; $p(X=x)=0$. However, $p(x)$ is still related to probability functions $f(x)$ through areas. For an arbitrarily small $\epsilon$ the probability that $X$ takes a value between $x-\epsilon$ and $x+\epsilon$ is the area of the distribution over that range; 

$$
\begin{aligned}
p( x - \epsilon< x < x+\epsilon) &= F(x+\epsilon) - F(x-\epsilon) \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{(x-+\epsilon)}f(x)dx - \int_{-\infty}^{(x-\epsilon)}f(x)dx
\end{aligned}
$$

Probability functions have to satisfy a few conditions: 

1. 
2. 
3.

## Expectation

expectation, variance, conditional or iterated expectations, law of total variance, variance of multiple variables

For any functions of a randome variable, $g(x)$, the expectation of that function is; 

$$
E_{x}(g(x))=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x)p(x)dx
$$

Expectation is a linear operator, so for constants $a$, $b$, and $c$ and random variables $x$ and $y$; $E(ax+by+c) = aE(x)+bE(y)+c$.

Expectation for joint random variables

$$
E_{x,y}(g(x,y))=\int_{s=x}\int_{t=y}g(s,t)f(s,t)dsdt
$$

Marginalizing a distribution from a joint probability function ($f(x,y)$) or a conditional probability function ($f(x|y)$):
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_x(x)&=\int_yf_{x,y}(x,y)dy\\
&=\int_y f_{x|y}(x|y)f_y(y)dy\\
&=E_y(f(x|y))
\end{aligned}
$$

[Law of total expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_expectation)

$$
E(x)=E(E(x|y))
$$

<!--
Linear regression as a conditional expectation
Could show a simple figure with Y~1 and Y~X as example of expectation versus conditional expectation

Conditional expectation 
$$
E(g(x)|Z)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p(x|Z)g(x)dx
$$

in linear regression, the expectation of Y is the linear combination of X and B, since those are deterministic, and the only non-deterministic part, epsilon, has expectation 0. 

- So the property that expectation propogates through sums leads to this result..

## Variance

Covariance and variance

$$
\begin{aligned}
Cov(X,Y)&=E_{x,y}((X-E_{x}(X))(Y-E_{y}(Y)))\\
Var(X)&=Cov(X,X)=E_{x}((X-E_{x}(X))^2)
\end{aligned}
$$

Constants and multiple random variables: 

$$
Var(aX+bY+c)=a^2Var(X)+b^2Var(Y)+2abCov(X,Y)
$$

Note, if $a$ or $b$ have different signs and $Cov(X,Y)>0$, then the variance between is reduced because the covariance is subtracted off. 

Variance of a function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(g(x)) &= E((g(x)-E(g(x)))^2)\\
&\approx \left(\frac{d}{dx}g(E(x))\right)^2var(x) 
\end{aligned}
$$


[Law of total variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_variance)
$$
Var(X)=E(Var(X|Y))+Var(E(X|Y))
$$

# Experiment Design

## Foundations

- Hypotheses
- Treatment and control conditions
- assumptions (including CI assumptions, SUTVA, ...?)

## Concerns

- network effects: front-end, it could be from different interactions, back-end it could be from changes in algorithm behavior for units in C based on different behavior from units in T -- e.g. if a new recommender for units in T influences them to watch more of x, then x may also get recommended more to those in C. 
- learning effects (change aversion, novelty seeking)
- early adopters
- Non-compliance: Those assicned to treatment may not actually experience the treatment. 
- Crossover: Those assigned to control might gain access to the treatment. 
- Treatment inhomogenaity: Some user segments might respond differently than others.


## Treatment Units

What is the unit at which we assign treatments? 

Ideally independent individuals, but online it is hard to know who is visiting a webpage, or crucial to keep experiences comparable across devices. Also, in networks, individuals are not independent and it is important to keep user experience consistent across connected individuals. 

Proxies for individuals include;

- User ID or account -- most clearly tied to a user, but 
- cookies -- device and browser specific, so these could differ across a user's browsers or devices.
- IP address (device request return address) -- device specific, so a user's experience might differ across devices.

In networks, loosely connected clusters of individuals can be used as experimental units (see unofficial google data science blog post on this).

- a solution to SUTVA violations, but decreases sample size and power dramatically

- cluster-based, stratified, serial, balanced, ... 

- propensity scores and matching

## Generative Model and Adjustment Variables

- Specify the hypothesized generative process
- Confounds
- Precision
- Neusance

## Common Designs

A/B testing

A/A testing to estimate variation

Variance reduction designs (paired designs, matching, ...)

Bandits for limited data or maximizing an objective

## Assignment Mechanism

- maps samples (xi,yi) into treatment or control conditions.
- randomized control trials ideal, not always possible
- other options, ...?

- test assignment validity, could use propensity scores or maybe chi square.

## Duration

- learning effects: initial exploration or novelty seeking
- learning effects: initial change aversion

- power analysis for sample size
- time to run to mitigate 

<!---
# Experiment Design

## Objective, demand, and value

Objective is based on a metric (increase clickthrough or revenue per user). 

Demand -- if adding a new user feature, how can demand for the feature be assessed? 

value = benefit - cost. 

Expected value helps with decisions about the size and duration of an experiment

## Constructs, metrics, and scoping

Once an objective is clear, the details of what can be measured need to be flushed out. 

Metrics (fill in from udamy course section on metrics)

Netflix metrics -- streaming hours, retention (users staying on platform), viewing for a title (e.g. effected by artwork -- but may be at the detrement of general viewing?) 

### User flow and target metrics

Think of the sequence of actions a user might take on the site. Experiments can target transtition probabilities between any user/platform states. 

- number of clicks
- time on page
- ... 

### Invariants

Metrics that shouldn't change or differ across groups. For example, demographic variables should be the same across groups if the randomization or balancing worked properly. Also, many application performance metrics and business metrics should be unchanged, or monitored just in case they change. 

### Confounding variables

Mitigated by randomization. 

### Precision variables

Can also highlight features that one would want to match treatment and control on.

Examples: 

- number of posts
- number of followers
- visibility / impressions

## Metric Validation

User expreience research, retrospective analyses of past data or log files, ... . 

## Conditions

Define the experimental manipulations. 

## Treatment Units

What is the unit at which we assign treatments? 

Ideally independent individuals, but online it is hard to know who is visiting a webpage, or crucial to keep experiences comparable across devices. Also, in networks, individuals are not independent and it is important to keep user experience consistent across connected individuals. 

Proxies for individuals include;

- User ID or account -- most clearly tied to a user, but 
- cookies -- device and browser specific, so these could differ across a user's browsers or devices.
- IP address (device request return address) -- device specific, so a user's experience might differ across devices.

In networks, loosely connected clusters of individuals can be used as experimental units (see unofficial google data science blog post on this).

## Assignment Mechanism 

The assignment mechanism samples members from a population and assignes them to conditions. 

How are units assigned to treatments?

Randomized control trials are the ideal, but many issues arise in online experimentation settings. 

(look up desirable properties form causal inference notes)

### Population 

What group is being sampled from?

### Cohorts

Random sample, cluster-based, stratified, serial, balanced, ... 

### Synthetic Control Groups

Propensity matching

### Limitations

- Non-compliance: Those assicned to treatment may not actually experience the treatment. 
- Crossover: Those assigned to control might gain access to the treatment. 
- Treatment inhomogenaity: Some user segments might respond differently than others.

# Implementation

Batched, or real-time

## Size

power, sample size

## Duration

- learning effects: initial exploration or novelty seeking
- learning effects: initial change aversion

Solution: Consider running experiment past any initial observed effect.

### Temporal variation

### Optional stopping

Why it's an issue for frequentists

Optamizely using a threshold on FDR from likelihood ratio tests in frequentist setting

Bayesian justifications

p-values versus likelihood ratios

## Estimands

- Average treatment effect
- Treatment on treated

## Effiencicy or Variance Reduction

- look up variance reduction in A/B tests, a common method might be to incorporate precision variables like demographic data or user data such as device or browser. 

e.g. with a two sample t-test, $Y_t - Y_{t-1} = \beta_0$, versus a model $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1}$

- get table for different tests of means from soc sci 10 notes.

## Checking assignment integrety

- Check demographics across buckets, if randomization worked then demographics should be approximately equally represented in the buckets.

## Integrety Checks

- check that those assigned to treatment received it
- check that stratifications were implemented correctly

- Check demographics across buckets, if randomization worked then demographics should be approximately equally represented in the buckets.
