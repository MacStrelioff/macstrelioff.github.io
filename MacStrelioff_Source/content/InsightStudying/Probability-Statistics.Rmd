Fermi problems (order of magnitude)

Stats: descriptive, R-squared, RMSE, chi-squared;  

combinatorics (permutations and combinations)

Probability: distributions, CLT, sampling distributions, p-value, 

t-test, ANOVA

Stats: k-s, Q-Q plot, hypothesis testing, experimentation; 

Probability: Bayes, bootstrap

Probability: maximum likelihood estimation; time series analysis (ARIMA models), granger causality

Dynamic experimentation (multi-armed bandits)

Unit testing; EDA visualization (seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh)
