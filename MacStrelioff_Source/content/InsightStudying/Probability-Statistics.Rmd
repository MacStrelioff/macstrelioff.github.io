Fermi problems (order of magnitude)

# Probability Foundations 

combinatorics (permutations and combinations)

## Probability Rules

basic probability rules

## Odds and other transformations

odds, log odds, relative risk, ... .

## Expectation and Variance

expectation, variance, conditional or iterated expectations, law of total variance, variance of multiple variables

# Experimental Design

## Estimands

## Control Groups

Propensity matching

## Effiencicy

e.g. with a two sample t-test, $Y_t - Y_{t-1} = \beta_0$, versus a model $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1}$

-- get table for different tests of means from soc sci 10 notes.

## Binary or Proportions

### Fisher's Z

## Real-Valued

### Regression

# Linear Models

regression

t-tests

ANOVA

t-test, ANOVA

# GLMs

Stats: descriptive, R-squared, chi-squared;  

Probability: distributions, CLT, sampling distributions, p-value, 


Stats: k-s, Q-Q plot, hypothesis testing, experimentation; 

Probability: Bayes, bootstrap

Probability: maximum likelihood estimation; time series analysis (ARIMA models), granger causality

Dynamic experimentation (multi-armed bandits)

Unit testing; EDA visualization (seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh)
