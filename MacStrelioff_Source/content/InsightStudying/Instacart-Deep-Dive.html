<h2>Business Model, Culture, and Vision</h2>
<p>Business model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instacart brings groceries online, through stores rather than through fulfillment centers (e.g. how Amazon does it).</li>
<li>Recently showed their model was profitable and sustainable</li>
<li>Became economical by batching orders, taking advantage of economies of scale, …</li>
<li>Gross margin positive, implying growth will be profitable</li>
<li>Tips can only go to the last person that touched order (delivery) even if they didn’t put together the order (pickers).</li>
<li>Brings incremental volume to grocery retailers</li>
<li>Around 50/% of grocers have same price on app as in store, others have markups</li>
<li>Seen as a antidote to Amazon by supporting local business</li>
<li>There’s a grocerie store within 10-15min from every household</li>
<li>Most valuable ads because they influence behavior right before the purchase</li>
<li>Want to build AdWords for groceries</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenue</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription or delivery fee from cusomter</li>
<li>Service fee partially goes towards balancing tips for delivery and picking.</li>
<li>fee from retailer</li>
<li>revenue from advertisers (talked about around 29:00)</li>
<li>coupons</li>
</ul>
<p>costs</p>
<ul>
<li>delivery costs, pickers and delivery (can be different people)</li>
<li>credit card transaction fees</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the impact that data scientists can have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minutes saved in deliveries is /$0.25 in gross margin, which can be passed to savings for the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the enturpneural spirit:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 months after Amazon bought Wholefoods, Instacart signed partnerships with nearly every large retailer</li>
</ul>

<div id="projects-tasks-and-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Projects, Tasks, and Data</h2>
<p>Open problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve predictability for shopper experience</li>
<li>Inventory prediction or modeling</li>
<li>Model for item substitutes (crowd source this so that orderers can specify acceptable substitutes?)</li>
<li>Labor models in local areas, accounting for unions and labor laws</li>
<li>Trust with person delivering produce</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion of past work</h3>
<p>“Be prepared to discuss your past work involving analyzing large and complicated datasets, defending your approaches and communicating what you learned during your project.”</p>
<p>“elaborate on related projects from your resume”</p>
<p>PredictIt Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation:</li>
<li>Project:</li>
<li>Maybe sketch the fig of price for Trump win versus Republican win</li>
<li>I also aggregated data based on days until expiration, and applied a linear in log odds model at each day.</li>
<li>Found the common S shaped calibration curve that comes up in lab experiments, particularly at 1-2 days before market expiration.</li>
<li>Result:</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: Relates to the economic patterns maybe?</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy Inference Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation:</li>
<li>Project:</li>
<li>Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions.</li>
<li>I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time.</li>
<li>Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time.</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user’s decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings.</li>
<li>More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings.</li>
</ul>
<p>General interest in decision making:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation: Models of multi-alternative decision making are often applied to food preferences to see how people integrate information about price, healthyness, flavor, … .</li>
<li>Excitement: Yelp is basically a giant experiment in multiattribute decision making.</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: Theoretical insights might help in guiding how restaurant informaiton is displayed to consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Insight Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses</li>
<li>Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy</li>
<li>Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant</li>
<li>Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features</li>
</ul>
