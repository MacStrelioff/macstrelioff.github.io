<h1>Principles</h1>
<ul>
<li>Interviews are conversations, not tests</li>
<li>Use stories to establish a connection and demonstrate fit for a role and company</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell me about yourself, your academic research, why data science?; 30 second elevator pitch vs. 2 minute phone screen/on-site</p>
<p>Why this company? what value can you add? Tell me about a time when…</p>

<h1>Common Behavioral Questions</h1>
<div id="tell-me-a-little-about-your-background." class="section level2">
<h2>“Tell me a little about your background.”</h2>
<p>This question gives an opportunity to demonstrate clear communication, curiosity, enthusiasm, transferrable skills, and value adds. This is also an opportunity to align past experience with the current job opportunity.</p>
<p>Template:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem: Concepts and context</li>
<li>Curiosity: Open question</li>
<li>Value: Why should people care</li>
<li>Project Outline: Methods, results</li>
</ul>
<p>Example answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open: I recently graduates from UC Irvine, where I studied statistics and cognitive science. I worked on a few lines of research, the one that was most interesting to me came out of an interest in prediction markets and arbitrage.</li>
<li>Problem: So prediction markets are a platform where people can buy and sell contracts on events that pay a dollar if the event occurs and nothing if it doesn’t occur. So for example, one market might be Who will win the 2020 election, and contracts might be ‘Bernie Sanders’, ‘Andrew Yang’, ‘Donnald Trump’, … . Since the contracts pay out $1, the theory is that the price should estimate the underlying probability of the event occuring. And since the market is aggregating information across individuals, it should be a pretty good estimate. However, individuals have shown a number of biases in probabilistic reasoning in lab studies, so I was wondering if these same biases would exist in prediction market prices. If they did, then I could make profitable trading algorithms.</li>
<li>So I partnered with a large online prediction market to get access to their data, and found evidence of some biases consistent with those observed in lab studies.</li>
<li>Trajectory: Overall, I realized that I enjoy these kinds of impactful analyses of real-world data, moreso than theory building through laboratory studies, so I decided to bridge into a career in data science, and joined Insight to become part of a network of data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication: Clearly explain prediction market mechanics.</li>
<li>Enthusasism: Interest in markets and complex problems.</li>
<li>Transferrable skills: Mention some of the models used.</li>
<li>Value adds: Realized prediction markets are biased close to expiration – their signal is weaker than previously thought. Also able to profit literally by rolling out trading algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<div id="child-bandits" class="section level3">
<h3>Child bandits:</h3>
<p>Bandit tasks are a common paradigm for studying individual level decision making and making claims about the way people make decisions. But in lots of contexts, the results you get when you addregate over trials can be different from the actual result on any trial. So I developed a model to infer on a trial by trial level, what decision making strategy kids were using to choose between two ‘bandits’ that gave out stickers. – I have an interest in using more customized models and Bayesian inference to overcome issues that arise from aggregating data at too high a level. If you had averaged over trials, then there may have been evidence for one or another model, but the dynamic changes in decision making strategies would have gone unnoticed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar approaches could be useful for dynamic experimental designs, OR in the context of Netflix, for personalization. If we could dynamically infer something like the strategy or emotional state of a user, then we could use that inference to personalize our recommended content or things like cover art or other aesthetic aspects of Netflix.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="tell-me-about-the-project-you-worked-on-at-insight." class="section level2">
<h2>“Tell me about the project you worked on at Insight.”</h2>
<p>This question gives an opportunity to demonstrate what you’ll be capable of on Day 1.</p>
<p>Template:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open: At Insight I worked on a consulting project for an external company. This company acquired users by offering a free trial, after which users would subscribe.</li>
<li>Purpose: Goals of the project were to to 1) identify, early on, who would become a subscriber, and 2) identify how the successful users were using the product.</li>
<li>Approach: I usually think about a generative process. Here I framed the problem as a classification problem and thought about using LDA or QDA because I thought the distributions of features would be different based on the classes.</li>
<li>Methods: Later thought about other algorithms because this was primarily a prediction problem, and because the assumption of normally distributed features was violated. So I tried tree-based algorithms and those performed the best across all metrics – F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall.</li>
<li>Challenges: Non-normal features (could break LDA, QDA)</li>
</ul>
<p>How could I have used a mixed effects model here? (See Maime’s blog?)</p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarity:</li>
<li>Relevance: Do the skills add value to the company?</li>
<li>Logic: Were sensible solutions tried in a sensible order?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="why-are-you-interested-in-a-career-as-a-data-scientist" class="section level2">
<h2>“Why are you interested in a career as a data scientist?”</h2>
<p>This is an opportunity to show that becoming a data sceientist at the company is the logical next career move, and to demonstrate that you know what to expect in the new role.</p>
<p>Outline of topics that may resonate with a hiring manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skills, Technical: Tools, technologies, methods you have used.</li>
<li>Skills, Conceptual: Your approach to understanding problems and navigating to solutions</li>
<li>Interests: What are you eager to do in this next phase of your professional life?</li>
<li>Interests, Broad: Knowledge of problems tackled by data professionals in this industry</li>
<li>Interests, Specific: Knowledge of technical challenges that will be faced by someone in this role</li>
<li>Growth, Skills: What you’re excited to learn in the next few years</li>
<li>Growth, Trajectory: Relate this job to an ultimate career trajectory</li>
</ul>
<p>Example answer: When I was in my PhD, I worked on a variety of projects and realized that I most enjoyed the ones that derived some impactful analysis from larger scale data – namely the prediction market project.</p>

<h2>“Talk about a time you were on a team that struggled with effective communication.”</h2>
<ul>
<li>Situation: Where / when did this happen? What were you working on, and with whom?</li>

<li>Action: How did you decide the appropriate response to the situation? How did you implement it?</li>
<li>Result: How do you know your solution was successful?</li>
<li><p>Takeaways: What did you learn from this situation? What would you do the same or differently next time?</p></li>
<li>Can’t think of one.. In community college I worked as a TA for my mentor, and I lead a research project which is very rare in community college settings. She was extremely supportive and I think communication and goals were clear across the team – I would make outlines / agendas for team meetings.</li>
<li>At UC Davis, for my Bachelors, my mentor was really bad with email. But he was nice, and his office door was always open, so whenever I needed something I would stop by and chat.</li>
<li>At Irvine people were always available via email or even phone if needed.</li>
<li><p>Also I had taken a consulting class as part of the stats masters, and a portion of that emphasized the importance of clear communication with clients, so in consulting relationships I maintain clear goals and deliverables.</p></li>

<h1>Cold Recruiter Email</h1>
<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/3-strategies-to-guarantee-a-data-science-job-with-no-experience-68d85b345f21">Blog on reaching out here</a>.</p>
<p>“Hey (Recruiter),</p>
<p>I know you’re really busy and you get a lot of emails. Found (Company) through angellist. Already applied for the Data Scientist position but wanted to reach out directly! Promise this email will be &lt; 60 seconds.</p>
<p>I’m Jeff and I’m a Data Scientist. A few things about me, I built the Data Scientist in Python &amp; R track for dataquest.io, used by hundreds of thousands of students and by companies such as Airbnb, Spotify, Uber etc so I excel in communicating technically complex topics to nontechnical audiences. On the technical side, I built “The Booki Monster” which is a monster that eats books and summarizes them using LDA &amp; Doc2Vec. App here(it takes a sec to load, so just be patient!) and explanation here. I also built the “Date-a Miner”, a convolutional neural network that automates online dating, by predicting the likelihood of me liking a profile and swiping for me.</p>
<p>In addition, I’m obsessed with figuring out how to learn things fast. As a result, I’m also working on an ambitious side-project called Month to Master where I attempt to master one difficult skill each month. Skills such as going from zero to conversational in Spanish in one month, memorizing the order of a 52 deck of cards in 3 minutes, completing 27 consecutive pull-ups etc.</p>
<p>Thanks again! I totally understand if you’re busy so no rush on reply. If you feel like there is a possible fit on your end, would love to further this conversation!</p>
<p>Hope you have a great week! Attached resume.</p>
<p>Best, Mac&quot;</p>
