Churn, engagement, search engine optimization (SEO), customer lifetime value (LTV), key-performance indicators (KPIs), funnel analysis

Experiment design, A/A and A/B testing, power analysis; 

ML focused business case study (features, algorithms, validation, value), business focused data challenges


# Template

## Value of a new feature

e.g. higher engagement, better labels for training data or other user behaivors

## Deamand for a feature

- Surveys
- Focus Groups
- UX interviews / shadows
- Retrospective analysis (looking at past user behavior)

## Treatment Design

How exactly will this be implemented in the treatment group? 

Specify treatment and control groups.

### Issues

- Networks: Users that interact might be in different conditions
- Learning effects: Users might respond differently initially than they do asymptotically. Can run experiments longer until the treatment effect seems to stabalize. 

## Constructs and Metrics

Engagement:

- Lift
- CTR
- Duration

Monetization: 

- CTR
- revenue per user
- add revenue
- ...

Guard Rail Metrics:

- 

## Metric evaluation and selection

1. What if we optimize for ... ?: The choice of metrics determines what the platform is being optimized for, so think about what will happen if the platform is optimized for the chosen metric.

### Method

### Size 

Power analysis

### Duration

Bandits versus A/B tests, 

### Other considerations: 

- Heterogenous treatment effects


# Example Question Formats


# Mock questions and templates 

## Monitoring Twitter serach

Metrics:

Measure health: 

Working well + being used … 

Track number of users using search! 

Consider people who have used the search once.. (can assess need) 


Use of search

 # users that use search

Usage (prop of users that interact with search)

 # users using search / # active users

Proportion of times a user comes and uses search 

Time interval(s):

Daily

Weekly

 # number of search sessions 

Total search volume (server traffic, … -- important!) 


Quality of search


Chose any suggestion

Rank of suggestion that they chose

Look at total number of searches, and searches in different categories / segmentations

Depends on infrastructure / ease of cutting later


-- favorites, retweets, … Other metrics from a deep-dive.


CUTS IN  DATA


Think of groups that might be using feature differently

New vs old users

Device type (iphone vs android) 

Browser



Conditions where the feature may be behaving differently (languages, countries, …) .. 

Note: countries would have different bandwidths (country easier to measure than bandiwdth itself) 

Language that the search is using. 




SPIKE IN THE METRIC # of searches


Bug


Event



Think of more people on platform moving with searches… 


 # clicks and # searches -- if it’s a bug, then clicks prob wouldn’t also spike.





Impressions, clicks, … 


Top of funnel, 


Logging in, going to search, writing stuff, hitting search .


‘Ok lets write down some ideas and see how we feel about them … ‘


Looking for intuition about how things will move and interact? 


Looking for: 

Organized in thinking

Incl understanding of problem space

Communicating thinking well
