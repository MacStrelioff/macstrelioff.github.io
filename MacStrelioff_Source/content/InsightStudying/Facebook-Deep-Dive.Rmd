## Marketing metrics

Marketing specific: 

- Incrementality (lift that wouldn't have happened but for the ad) 
- CPA (cost per acquisition) 
- ROAS (return on ad spend) 
- ROI (return on investment) 
- PPC (pay per click)

One ROI formula: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
n_{leads} &: \text{Number of leads} \\
p_c &: \text{Lead to customer conversion rate} \\
\bar{s} &:\text{Average sales price per customer} \\ 
ROI &:\frac{n_{leads} p_c \bar{s} - cost}{cost}
\end{aligned}
$$

- ROI can be extended to include additional traffic, likes on social media, stronger brand (more trust, familarity, ...)

[Retargeting](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide): Ads to a user who previously visited but did not convert

- Pixel-based retargeting: A Pixel refers to JavaScript code placed on a visitors browser (to "cookie" the browser). The cookie notifies retargeting platforms to serve specific ads. The advantage of pixel-based retargeting is that it is timely (they can be retargeted pretty immediately after leaving your site), specific to a particular page on your site, and behavior-based. Downsides to this method are that there is a lower volume of people in the campaign at any given moment in time since it's all based on how often people are coming to your website, viewing certain pages, and leaving. It also can be complicated or time-intensive to implement the JavaScript on many website pages. 
- List-based retargeting: Upload a list of emails or other identifying information to an ad server (e.g. facebook), then target ads to only those people. 


General: 

- Impressions
- Link Clicks
- Pageviews
- Deeper funnel conversions recorded via fb pixles
- Cost per click
- Post engagements on business page
- Session duration
- Pages/session
- conversion funnel

- per week
- per month

## Maime tips:

- If it's a seperate org interview is prob still similar.
- Maime didn't have a great experience with SMG group (small medium business)
- Maime's cohort they didn't get back to someone until towards the end of the year. They were on a hiring freeze.
- Maime was for incoming PhD grad role. 
- Maime tech screen; 
- half coding, half analytics, half SQL
- don't code for python algos, coding was only SQL
- In general, product/open ended, and statsy questions. Like 3 open ended and a stats session.
- very very deep dive. 
- Should be ready for an analytics problem with fb marketplace. 
- They expect you to know facebook because it's so widely known
- Get a lot of context, deep dive products, pages, news feed, events. Know them well. 
- Know how they generate revenue, what metrics they care about. 
- Should be able to rattle off like 10 metrics for whatever question.
- Especially the case for well known companies. 
- Should already know metrics, not need to brainstorm them on the spot.
- Complicated queries -- Lots of logical stuff, tricky questions. 
- Be comfortable with medium level on Leetcode and hacker rank.

In general, interviewing well -- know how to ask for help for SQL and clarificaion. Verbalize what you're stuck on and need help on. 

Draw intermediate tables. If I could get here -- I'd .. . But I'm stuck on this step 1 part. 

FB really good at accomidating schedule. Maime got onsite quickly. 
Should see it through, I might love the team or like working there. Could get a good compensation package. 
Recruiters will ask where you're interviewing, you can tell them. 

Hesitate when they ask about how much the offer is... .
