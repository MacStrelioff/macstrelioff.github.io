basic structures (tuples, list, arrays, dict), list comprehensions, 

Complexity + O(N) notation

# Searching

binary search, 

# Sorting

sorting (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick)

Sorting and graph algos (depth-first and breadth-first seach)

sorting (heap, tim)

# Data Structures

Data structures (hash, stack, queue, tree, linked list); 

# Algorithms

lambda functions;

recursion; 

Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programming (knapsack problem, Fibonacci sequence)

Functional programming

# Tools

git for version control (resolving merge conflicts)
