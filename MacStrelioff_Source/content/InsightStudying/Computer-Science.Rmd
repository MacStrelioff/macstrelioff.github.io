```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# libraries
library(reticulate)

# setup python usage
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = ">>>")
#py_discover_config() # to see versions of Python
use_python("/anaconda3/bin/python")

# set seed for reproducability

```

# Foundations

Data type manipulation (char, string, numeric) regular expressions; 

basic structures (tuples, list, arrays, dict), list comprehensions, 

Complexity + O(N) notation

# Searching

binary search, 

```{python}

print(1+5)



```

# Sorting

sorting (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick)

Sorting and graph algos (depth-first and breadth-first seach)

sorting (heap, tim)

## Sort Algorithms

Lots of [sort algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)

## Search Algorithms

Lots of [search algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Search_algorithms)

## Ranking Algorithms

Lots of [ranking algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_(information_retrieval))

## Recommendation

Lots of [recommendation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system)

Data science methods play a major role in discovering recommendations for users. 

Econ, compliments and substitutes (competitors). 

Types of recommendation; compliments (these go together), competitors (you might also like...), temporal (might buy this again in the future). Horizontal and vertical focus 

Temporal involves forecasting, which is a topic for another post. 

# Data Structures

Data structures (hash, stack, queue, tree, linked list); 

# Algorithms

lambda functions;

recursion; 

Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programming (knapsack problem, Fibonacci sequence)

Functional programming

# Tools

git for version control (resolving merge conflicts)
