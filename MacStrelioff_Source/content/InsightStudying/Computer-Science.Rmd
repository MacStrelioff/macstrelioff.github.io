# Foundations

Data type manipulation (char, string, numeric) regular expressions; 

## Data Structures

basic structures (tuples, list, arrays, dict), list comprehensions, 

Good descriptions of [lists](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/AlgorithmAnalysis/Lists.html), [dicts](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/AlgorithmAnalysis/Dictionaries.html), and [why some operations are much faster in sets or dict keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8929284/what-makes-sets-faster-than-lists).

In depth description of [hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table?fbclid=IwAR1N5-jAoM9e6iY58CDP9MAwycenvOXXJwmkpa0eBVDKed3RBs9uVBm9Kkc). 

Data structures (hash, stack, queue, tree, linked list); 

## Trees

### Binary search trees



## Database and SQL

SQL training resources;

- [sqlbot](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction)
- [Mode Analytics](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/) HackerRank (basic select, aggregation)
- [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)
- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_select1)

## Complexity

computational or memory...

Complexity + O(N) notation


```{python}
print(1+5)
a = 5
```

# Sorting

sorting (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick)

Sorting and graph algos (depth-first and breadth-first seach)

sorting (heap, tim)

Lots of [sort algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)

e.g. 'find median in a large dataset' -- sort half of it.

# Searching

binary search,

Lots of [search algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Search_algorithms)

# Ranking Algorithms

Lots of [ranking algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_(information_retrieval))

# Recommendation

Lots of [recommendation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system)


<!---
Data science methods play a major role in discovering recommendations for users. 

Econ, compliments and substitutes (competitors). 

Types of recommendation; compliments (these go together), competitors (you might also like...), temporal (might buy this again in the future). Horizontal and vertical focus 

Temporal involves forecasting, which is a topic for another post.

# Algorithms

lambda functions;

```{python}

nums=[1,1,2,2,1]
val=1

count = 0
for i in range(len(nums)):
  if nums[i] != val:
    nums[count] = nums[i]
    count += 1

print(count)
print(nums)
```


recursion; 

Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programming (knapsack problem, Fibonacci sequence)

Functional programming

# Tools

git for version control (resolving merge conflicts)
