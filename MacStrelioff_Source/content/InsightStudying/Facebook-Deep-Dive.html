<div id="maime-tips" class="section level2">
<h2>Maime tips:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If it’s a seperate org interview is prob still similar.</li>
<li>Maime didn’t have a great experience with SMG group (small medium business)</li>
<li>Maime’s cohort they didn’t get back to someone until towards the end of the year. They were on a hiring freeze.</li>
<li>Maime was for incoming PhD grad role.</li>
<li>Maime tech screen;</li>
<li>half coding, half analytics, half SQL</li>
<li>don’t code for python algos, coding was only SQL</li>
<li>In general, product/open ended, and statsy questions. Like 3 open ended and a stats session.</li>
<li>very very deep dive.</li>
<li>Should be ready for an analytics problem with fb marketplace.</li>
<li>They expect you to know facebook because it’s so widely known</li>
<li>Get a lot of context, deep dive products, pages, news feed, events. Know them well.</li>
<li>Know how they generate revenue, what metrics they care about.</li>
<li>Should be able to rattle off like 10 metrics for whatever question.</li>
<li>Especially the case for well known companies.</li>
<li>Should already know metrics, not need to brainstorm them on the spot.</li>
<li>Complicated queries – Lots of logical stuff, tricky questions.</li>
<li>Be comfortable with medium level on Leetcode and hacker rank.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, interviewing well – know how to ask for help for SQL and clarificaion. Verbalize what you’re stuck on and need help on.</p>
<p>Draw intermediate tables. If I could get here – I’d .. . But I’m stuck on this step 1 part.</p>
<p>FB really good at accomidating schedule. Maime got onsite quickly. Should see it through, I might love the team or like working there. Could get a good compensation package. Recruiters will ask where you’re interviewing, you can tell them.</p>
<p>Hesitate when they ask about how much the offer is… .</p>
