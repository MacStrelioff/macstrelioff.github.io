<p>I like their general work on <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/projects/jobs">inferring user attributes</a>, <a href="https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/research#all">economic research</a>, <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~msaveski/assets/publications/2017_detecting_network_effects/paper.pdf">experimentation research</a> (also <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488509&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL">here</a>, <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/06/detecting-interference--an-a-b-test-of-a-b-tests">here</a>), <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2741126">latent user research</a>,</p>

<h3>Excitement from Recruiter</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2015/11/video--higher-ed-team-seeks-to-predict-collegiate-futures">Student Future</a>, a product to help high school students choose universities, based on entering a company and a role and seeing statistics about the schools that people with those jobs attended.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/07/29/inday-investing-in-our-employees-so-they-can-invest-in-themselves">InDay</a> – LinkedIn officially takes one day a month to allow employees to give back to the community, company, or themselves in some (themed) way.</li>
<li><a href="https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/resources/linkedin-workforce-report-may-2018">Economics graph</a> project that gives reports on skills gaps and migrations.</li>
<li>I noticed the job ad emails that I get seem based on my job search, possibly more-so than my skills.. Do you think you’d get more retention / engagement by recommending jobs based on skills or degrees and work history, rather than past searches? Or at least exploring this – randomizing emails to suggest jobs based on search vs based on skills and experience.</li>
