<h3>HaaS freelance work</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haas stands for housing as a service, it’s a membership-based coliving startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to increase memberships through facebook and google ads.</li>
<li>I’m leveraging a little SEO experience to help with designing ads;</li>
<li>Brighter photos, photos with faces, and color schemes that contrast FB’s color scheme of white and blue,</li>
<li>thse features are associated with higher CTR for YouTube thumbnails.</li>
<li>Becoming familiar with Google Analytics and Facebook Ad Analytics to run A/B tests with these ads</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>See which drive more interest in CTR, and more conversions in applications for membership, and which attract the demographics that my client wants to attract.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Insight Project</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 week consulting project</li>
<li>Startup focused on digital workspaces (e.g. google docs)</li>
<li>Wanted to understand user base.</li>
<li>Wanted to be able to predict who would convert from a free trial to a paying customer.</li>
<li>(skip) Wanted to attribute conversion to product features with conversion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data:</li>
<li>Company demographic information, company size and revenue.</li>
<li>Used this to communicate conversion rates by demographic to heads of different teams using tables and figures.</li>
<li>Account activity data which was a sum of actions taken within an account each day.</li>
<li>I transformed this into cumulative sum instead of daily sum to increase interpretability and modeling ease.</li>
</ul>
<p>(skip) Action: (skip) - Used cross sections of cumulative account activity data after 7 days since the account was created. (skip) - Cast as classification problem, used SMOTE to address class imbalance, (skip) - used 5-fold CV to evaluate models on AUC, (skip) - ended with a RF algorithm for these predictions.</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivered presentation and slide deck with tables and figures to a group of team leaders.</li>
<li>Delivered a Python script to implement the model, and a slide deck describing the modeling procedure and performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PredictIt project</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets aggregate information and incentivize rational behavior, so one would expect the prices to be accurate.</li>
<li>At an individual level, lots of fallacies have been established in lab settings.</li>
<li>I wanted to know if any fallacies would manifest in market prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conjunction fallacy: “Trump” traded higher hand “Republican” for extended period of time.</li>
<li>Disjunction fallacy: Most market prices add up to something greater than $1, but because of fees it’s often not profitable to take advantage of this.</li>
<li>CPT subjective probability function: Overpricing of low probability events and Underpricing of high probability events</li>
<li><p>– notably this was highest as expiration approached, a context that is more similar to lab studies that don’t have delayed rewards.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we’re working on automating trades based on these and other indights.</p></li>

<h3>Child bandit modeling</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted to know what strategies they followed, and if their strategy changed over time.</li>
<li>Kids repeatedly chose between two gambling machines</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>I developed a model that inferred the probability of following each strategy on each trial</li>
<li>Used Bayes’ Rule to smooth out these inferences / accumulate information over trials</li>
</ul>
<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids do seem to switch strategies, probably don’t act optimally, and have different strategies depending on age (switchy vs sticky)</li>
<li>Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time.</li>

<li><a href="https://labs.pinterest.com/user/themes/pin_labs/assets/paper/pinning-www17.pdf">Predicting Intent Using Activity Logs</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Pinterest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content sharing platform, and image based search engine</li>
<li>Prior research found user types; 1) casual browsers, 2) responding to a specific goals</li>
<li>Prior research found different temporal horizons, e.g. using Pintrest to plan dinner versus using Pintrest to plan vacations.</li>
<li>On Pintrest users view pins (content) to boards (collections).</li>
<li>Pins have 33 categories (DIY, food and drink, …)</li>
<li>Users can look at closeups of Pins, which provides additional information</li>
<li>Users can click through to visit a site affiliated with a pin</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem and volue of a solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can use a product with different intents, and the material that a user finds valuable may depend on their intent.</li>
<li>Being able to infer a user’s intent from their behavior during a session would enable a personalized experience aligned with a user’s goals.</li>
<li>Example: Someone looking for dinner recepies might want something they can quickly make with common ingredients, while someone looking for potluck ideas might want more unique dishes, and someone who is just browsing food might prefer a variety of exotic food images.</li>
<li>User intent can vary with each session, so quickly identifying intent within a session can help with changing the interface and content shown to the user in real time based on their inferred intent</li>
</ul>
<p>Current paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goals: Understand how intent informs behavior, and whether intent can be inferred from behavior.</li>
<li>Two dimensions of intent:</li>
<li>Goal specificity: whether the intent is stimulus specific (glutin free chocolate chip recepies) or vague (just browsing to pass time).</li>
<li>and temporal range: Time horizon for goal completion (tonight, next week, next month, …).</li>
<li>In psych, motivation is defined as a directing and activating or invigorating force. The directional component maps onto what Pintrest is calling goal specificity, and the invigorating component might map onto the inverse of what Pintrest refers to as temporal range.</li>
<li>In psych, there’s a notion of goal-directed and habitual behavior. The former is driven by a specific desired outcome (similar to goal specificity here) while the later is a less mindful response to stimuli (eg boredom triggers a passive arousal seeking).</li>
<li>In social psych, attitudes have been thought about along a gradient of specificity – so maybe things like time-related words in a query can be used to identify goal-directed users.</li>
<li>Shopping websites can be used for a specific purchase (goal-directed) or in an experiential way (habitual).</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample: 5369 females mean age 33.5, 564 males mean age 38.6, all from US and on Pintrest during July 2016</li>
<li>Survey asking;</li>
<li>7 point likert scale: “Are you visiting Pintrest with a goal in mind?”</li>
<li>“When are you planning to act on what you’re looking for today”</li>
<li>Question about Pintrest specific motivations (eg finding DIY ideas)</li>
<li>“What are you looking for on Pintrest today?” Response options were based on Pintrest categories</li>
<li>Focused on data in the session immediately following the survey</li>
<li>primarily analyzed first 10 minutes because this window had peak performance, around 27% of sessions had fewer than 10 minutes</li>
<li>Over 850,000 behavioral events (views, closeups, searches) across 5933 users within 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Also analyzed behavior from when the user first created account until a week after survey completion</li>
<li>used Holm-corrected p-values, a method that is more powerful than a the conservative Bonferroni correction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigating limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>coverage bias: mitigated by uniformly sampling from users for inclusion</li>
<li>participation bias: compared activity of users who completed the survey (addigned survey, took survey) to those who saw the survey popup but did not complete the survey (assigned survey, did not take survey).</li>
<li>Survey takers had been using Pintrest longer, and had more saved pins. Inferred from this that engaged users were</li>
</ul>
<p>Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal-specific users are: more focused, search more (1.1 vs 0.4 searches), spend more time browsing specific categories of content in detail, more likely to reference saved content, less likely to return in next 7 days, less likely to attribute their visit to boredom (2% vs 25% for habitual), more likely to attribute visit to making something (26% vs 5% for habitual)</li>
<li>users with short term goals: specific categories of content, likely to reference saved content, less likely to save new content, goal-specific users more likely to act in short term, habitual users more unsure of taking actions</li>
<li>Demographic differences: females more likely to be goal-specific (49% vs 40%), males unsure of taking action, older users more short-term goals, younger users more unsure of taking action, food, drink, DIY searches more likely to be goal-specific and act in short term, travel, entertainment more likely to be habitual and likely to act in long term, intent moderates the type of recepies users save</li>
<li>Model can predict goal specificity and temporal range.</li>
<li>Current session data is most informative, historical activity data also helpful</li>
