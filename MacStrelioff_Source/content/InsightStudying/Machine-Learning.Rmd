# Considerations

## Bias-variance trade-off

## Overfitting and Underfitting

Cross Validation; Classification

## Cost Functions and Metrics

Modeling: Validation metrics, 

metrics (precision, recall, F1)

regularisation (ridge, lasso), 

## Feature Engineering

### Seperability

### Assumptions about form of relationship

Process: feature selection, data cleaning / imputation with common pitfalls, model training, bias-variance trade-off
