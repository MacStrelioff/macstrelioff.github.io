# Unsupervised
Unsupervised: kmeans + heirarchical clustering, PCA; 
Unsupervised: SVD/LDA/LSA; 

# Supervised

Supervised: linear + logistic regression (derive); 
Supervised: trees and forests, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN; 

# Process

Modeling: Validation metrics, regularisation (ridge, lasso), 
Cross Validation; Classification + metrics (precision, recall, F1)
Process: boosting, feature selection, data cleaning / imputation with common pitfalls, model training, bias-variance trade-off
