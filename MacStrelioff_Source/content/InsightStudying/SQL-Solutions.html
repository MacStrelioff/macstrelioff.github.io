<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>exists ([subquery])</code>: True if the subquery is not empty</li>
<li><code>ROLLUP(facid,month)</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>ROLLUP</code> produces a hierarchy of aggregations in the order passed into it: for example, ROLLUP(facid, month) outputs aggregations on (facid, month), (facid), and (). If we wanted an aggregation of all facilities for a month (instead of all months for a facility) we’d have to reverse the order, using ROLLUP(month, facid). Alternatively, if we instead want all possible permutations of the columns we pass in, we can use CUBE rather than ROLLUP. This will produce (facid, month), (month), (facid), and ().</p>
