# Recruiter call

"Just be prepared to share with me what you are looking for, what is exciting to you and feel free to have questions ready about the team, role, business etc"

<!-- excitement -->

- Groceries have been hard for internet companies to get right -- it's exciting to see Instacart managing this well, and I'd be excited to be a part of this technological revolution of grocery delivery


<!-- questions -->

- More about role?
- general interview at this point, then team placement later? 
- to see what product team is best, then match that with their priorities
- data cleaning, kpis, models
- experimentation heavy
- DS vs ml; DS models increase understanding and guide decisions
- hiring in customer - growth, retention and engagement, marketing, core product
- and in performance - delivery logistics and operations for shoppers, fulfillment, shoppers and delivery
- - surrounding shopper model incentivized by flexibility in hours, and pay structure. 
- - competitive - they could be in postmates, doordash, ...
- - incitives, earnings, ... 
- - focused on incentivizing quality rather and balancing with speed.
- - experiment with different incentive structures.. 
- and in ads platform - cupons, product promotions (buy 1 get 1 free), ... 
- - all from brand partners
- - sales drive brand partners into business
- - DS around 10 individuals
- currently have 5 products in ads now, some tools help partners decide how to spend dollars

- Specific needs or challenges?

- Instacart growing at a pace faster than others in the bay area
- DS only 25 individuals, still one head of DS
- DS highly valuable and high ownership

- Sr contributor, prioritization important. 
- Each product team is cross functional, 1DS, 1 designer, 1-8 SWE, and a product manager. Desks are organized around these. 
- Owning metrics with the product teams. 
- E.g. earnings model might be partnering with growth team and delivery logistics side
- Report into a DS leader for mentorship, collaboration, ... .
- Still have autonomy and collaboration in day to day

- variety of team members in interview to chat about different projects
- feel free to ask about their day to day

Next steps

- problem solving phone interview (45min) - business case problem from a Sr DS, high level instacart related problem. E.g. how would we gain more customers, retain more customers. Something you'd think of as a DS. ask insightful questions, setup framework correctly, back up analysis and solution over phone. Looking how you organize thoughts and pivot thinking, might have a wrench thrown. 
- statistics SQL phone interview (45min). Stats 101, SQL is a necessity so quick 15 min exercise should be straightforward. 
-- coding over shared doc? 
-- first 30min over phone, next 30min online through a link 
- Onsite interview with a lot of topics. Experimental design, live DS project with clean data. Want to see how I solve it and present answers. Multiple ways of answering prompt. 
- project in three sessions; 
- 1 framework and metrics, 2 doing the work, 3 presentation to team of DS, strengths and weaknesses and justification of choices
- experimental design, problem solving/product sense

- hiring leader on customers will be out of office starting October 7th 

- will be asked about compensition at onsite.
- DS, Sr DS, Staff DS -- depends on interviews, and determines pay range. Will get cash based and equity in RSUs and then benefits. 
- Sr range between 170-190k on cash. Look at technical contributions, level of inititive, thought leadership, 400-600k over 4 years of equity. 


# Company Visit


## Business Model, Culture, and Vision

Business model:

- Instacart brings groceries online, through stores rather than through fulfillment centers (e.g. how Amazon does it).
- Recently showed their model was profitable and sustainable
- Became economical by batching orders, taking advantage of economies of scale, ...
- Gross margin positive, implying growth will be profitable
- Tips can only go to the last person that touched order (delivery) even if they didn't put together the order (pickers). 
- Brings incremental volume to grocery retailers
- Around 50/% of grocers have same price on app as in store, others have markups
- Seen as a antidote to Amazon by supporting local business
- There's a grocerie store within 10-15min from every household
- Most valuable ads because they influence behavior right before the purchase
- Want to build AdWords for groceries

Revenue

- Subscription or delivery fee from cusomter
- Service fee partially goes towards balancing tips for delivery and picking. 
- fee from retailer
- revenue from advertisers (talked about around 29:00)
- coupons 

costs

- delivery costs, pickers and delivery (can be different people)
- credit card transaction fees

I like the impact that data scientists can have:

- Minutes saved in deliveries is /$0.25 in gross margin, which can be passed to savings for the customer

I like the enturpneural spirit: 

- 6 months after Amazon bought Wholefoods, Instacart signed partnerships with nearly every large retailer 

## Projects, Tasks, and Data

Open problems:

- Improve predictability for shopper experience
- Inventory prediction or modeling
- Model for item substitutes (crowd source this so that orderers can specify acceptable substitutes?)
- Labor models in local areas, accounting for unions and labor laws
- Trust with person delivering produce

### Discussion of past work
"Be prepared to discuss your past work involving analyzing large and complicated datasets, defending your approaches and communicating what you learned during your project."

"elaborate on related projects from your resume"

PredictIt Project:

- Situation: 
- Project: 
- Maybe sketch the fig of price for Trump win versus Republican win
- I also aggregated data based on days until expiration, and applied a linear in log odds model at each day. 
- Found the common S shaped calibration curve that comes up in lab experiments, particularly at 1-2 days before market expiration.
- Result: 
- Value to Yelp: Relates to the economic patterns maybe? 

Strategy Inference Project:

- Situation: 
- Project: 
- Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions. 
- I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time. 
- Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials -- the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time. 
- Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user's decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings. 
- More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings. 

General interest in decision making: 

- Situation: Models of multi-alternative decision making are often applied to food preferences to see how people integrate information about price, healthyness, flavor, ... . 
- Excitement: Yelp is basically a giant experiment in multiattribute decision making. 
- Value to Yelp: Theoretical insights might help in guiding how restaurant informaiton is displayed to consumers. 

Insight Project: 

- User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses
- Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy
- Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant
- Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features

### Product metrics or experimentation
"You have a good chance of getting a product metrics or experimentation question based on some actual questions Yelp is tackling at the moment."

## User Flows and Metrics

Thinking of the broader user flow can help with identifying measurable events within that flow (metrics).
Overall, consider units of individuals (accounts, unique visitors, cookies, IPs...), units of time (daily, weekly), and referents (week over week, ...)

- good source for some key [metrics](https://www.yelp.com/knowledge)

### On Web

1. Users (IPs) arrive on Yelp, can be assigned a cookie, or associated with an account if the user creates one. 

- Growth: DAU, MAU
- Growth: monthly new users, monthly unique users
- Engagement: Reviews per user per month
- Engagement: 
- Engagement: Traffic to business pages
- Monetization: Reservations
