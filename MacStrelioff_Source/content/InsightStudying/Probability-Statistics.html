# What is a probability, and how does that relate to statistics? 

- Probabilities are commonly thought of in three ways; 

1. Purely mathematical
2. Magnitudes of belief
3. Relative frequencies of infinate events

I use probability theory to quantify beliefs and make decisions. 

Logic, about truths of the universe. 
By there is uncertainty in what we know, and uncertainty in our measurements and observations. Statistics as a field is concerned with specifying our knowledge of the laws of the universe and the uncertainty around them. They do this by applying probability theory. 

Probability theory generalizes logic to situations where we aren't certain. And logic emerges from probability theory when we know things with certainty. 

Hypothesis testing

Statisticians use probability theory to decide on what is and isn't true

<div id="events-and-random-variables" class="section level1">
<h1>Events and Random Variables</h1>
<p>Events, event spaces,</p>
<p>combinatorics (permutations and combinations)</p>
<p>A random variable random variable is a variable with an unknown value, but known possible values. An event is an observed value of a random variable. An event space contains all possible values of the random variable. Probabilities are values assigned to the events in an event space (i.e. the possible values of a random variable) and represent how likely each event is relative to other events in the event space.</p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(p(e)\)</span> will be used to represent the probability of an event. Some special probabilities include the probability of any event in the event space, which is 1. And the probability of any event other than <span class="math inline">\(p(e)\)</span>, known as the compliment of <span class="math inline">\(p(e)\)</span>, denoted with <span class="math inline">\(p(\neg e)\)</span>, is found by;</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(\neg e) = 1 - p(e)
\]</span></p>
<div id="probability-rules" class="section level2">
<h2>Probability Rules</h2>
<p>A joint event refers to two or more events occurring together. They are colloquially talked about as one event ‘and’ another event occurring together. More formally, joint events are called intersections (represented with the <span class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span> symbol) between events. For events <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span>, the probability of their joint event will be represented with <span class="math inline">\(p(e_1 \cap e_2)\)</span>. The probability of an intersection of events is the same regardless of which event is considered first;</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(e_1 \cap e_2) = p(e_2 \cap e_1)
\]</span></p>
<p>For two events, <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span>, their intersection is found by; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1 \&amp; e_2) = p(e_1\cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p(e_1|e_2)\)</span> is a conditional probability, discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>Conditional events refer to one event, <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span>, after another event, <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span>, is known. <span class="math inline">\(p(e_1|e_2)\)</span> represents the probability of <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> given, or after knowing, <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span>. These can be defined by rearranging the multiplication rule as follows; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2)=p(e_1\cap e_2) \rightarrow p(e_1|e_2)= \frac{p(e_1\cap e_2)}{p(e_2)}
\]</span></p>
<p>Noting that, by the reflexively of joint events and the definition of the multiplication rule, <span class="math inline">\(p(e_1 \cap e_2) = p(e_2 \cap e_1)= p(e_2 | e_1) p(e_1)\)</span>, and so the above equation becomes; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1|e_2)=\frac{p(e_2 | e_1) p(e_1)}{p(e_2)}
\]</span> This equation is known as Bayes’ Theorem or Bayes’ Rule.</p>
<p>A union (represented with the <span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span> symbol) of events refers to at least one of multiple events occurring. For events, <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span>, their union would include the probability that <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> occurs, the probability that or <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span> occurs, and the probability that both <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span> occur. Colloquially this is talked about the probability of <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> ‘or’ <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span>. Formally this is expressed and computed as; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1\text{ or } e_2) = p(e_1 \cup e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1 \cap e_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(p(e_1 \cap e_2)\)</span> is a joint probability.</p>
<p>Independence is a common assumption in many statistical techniques. Statisticians assume independence primarily because it simplifies the computation of certain probabilities. Events are said to be independent if knowing one event does not change the probability of the other event. Formally, if events <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span> are independent, this would mean that; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1|e_2) = p(e_1) \text{ and } p(e_2|e_1) = p(e_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span> are independent, then their joint probability simplifies as so; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1 \cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) = p(e_1)p(e_2)
\]</span> Where the last equality is only true if <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span> are independent (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p(e_1|e_2)=p(e_1)\)</span>).</p>
<p>Then the probability of their union simplifies to; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1 \cup e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1)p(e_2)
\]</span> Where again, the last part of this equality is only true if <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span> are independent.</p>
<p>Events <span class="math inline">\(e_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_2\)</span> are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of either event precludes the occurrence of the other event. Formally mutual exclusivity means that; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1 | e_2) = 0 \text{ and } p(e_2 | e_1) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>If two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of their joint event is; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1 \cap e_2) = p(e_1|e_2)p(e_2) = 0*p(e_2) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>And the probability of their union simplifies to; <span class="math display">\[
p(e_1 \cup e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - p(e_1 \cap e_2) = p(e_1) + p(e_2) - 0 = p(e_1) + p(e_2)
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="probability-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Probability Functions</h2>
<!--
Many machine learning algorithms are different ways of estimating f(x)
-->
<p>Here I’ll describe the properties and use cases for probability functions and cumulative probability functions. Conventionally, use <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is used represent a probability function, and <span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span> to represent a cumulative probability function. <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is commonly called a probability mass function (pmf) if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is discrete, and a probability density function (pdf) if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is continuous. <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span> are related through integration:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &amp;= \frac{d}{dx}F(x) \\
F(x) &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>For discrete variables, the probability function represents the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> takes a specific value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = p(X=x)\)</span>. For continuous variables, the probability that the variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> takes any particular value is technically <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(p(X=x)=0\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is still related to probability functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> through areas. For an arbitrarily small <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> takes a value between <span class="math inline">\(x-\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x+\epsilon\)</span> is the area of the distribution over that range;</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
p( x - \epsilon&lt; x &lt; x+\epsilon) &amp;= F(x+\epsilon) - F(x-\epsilon) \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{(x-+\epsilon)}f(x)dx - \int_{-\infty}^{(x-\epsilon)}f(x)dx
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>

# Experiment Design

## Objective, demand, and value

Objective is based on a metric (increase clickthrough or revenue per user). 

Demand -- if adding a new user feature, how can demand for the feature be assessed? 

value = benefit - cost. 

Expected value helps with decisions about the size and duration of an experiment

## Constructs, metrics, and scoping

Once an objective is clear, the details of what can be measured need to be flushed out. 

Metrics (fill in from udamy course section on metrics)

Netflix metrics -- streaming hours, retention (users staying on platform), viewing for a title (e.g. effected by artwork -- but may be at the detrement of general viewing?) 

### User flow and target metrics

Think of the sequence of actions a user might take on the site. Experiments can target transtition probabilities between any user/platform states. 

- number of clicks
- time on page
- ... 

### Invariants

Metrics that shouldn't change or differ across groups. For example, demographic variables should be the same across groups if the randomization or balancing worked properly. Also, many application performance metrics and business metrics should be unchanged, or monitored just in case they change. 

### Confounding variables

Mitigated by randomization. 

### Precision variables

Can also highlight features that one would want to match treatment and control on.

Examples: 

- number of posts
- number of followers
- visibility / impressions

## Metric Validation

User expreience research, retrospective analyses of past data or log files, ... . 

## Conditions

Define the experimental manipulations. 

## Treatment Units

What is the unit at which we assign treatments? 

Ideally independent individuals, but online it is hard to know who is visiting a webpage, or crucial to keep experiences comparable across devices. Also, in networks, individuals are not independent and it is important to keep user experience consistent across connected individuals. 

Proxies for individuals include;

- User ID or account -- most clearly tied to a user, but 
- cookies -- device and browser specific, so these could differ across a user's browsers or devices.
- IP address (device request return address) -- device specific, so a user's experience might differ across devices.

In networks, loosely connected clusters of individuals can be used as experimental units (see unofficial google data science blog post on this).

## Assignment Mechanism 

The assignment mechanism samples members from a population and assignes them to conditions. 

How are units assigned to treatments?

Randomized control trials are the ideal, but many issues arise in online experimentation settings. 

(look up desirable properties form causal inference notes)

### Population 

What group is being sampled from?

### Cohorts

Random sample, cluster-based, stratified, serial, balanced, ... 

### Synthetic Control Groups

Propensity matching

### Limitations

- Non-compliance: Those assicned to treatment may not actually experience the treatment. 
- Crossover: Those assigned to control might gain access to the treatment. 
- Treatment inhomogenaity: Some user segments might respond differently than others.

# Implementation

Batched, or real-time

## Size

power, sample size

## Duration

- learning effects: initial exploration or novelty seeking
- learning effects: initial change aversion

Solution: Consider running experiment past any initial observed effect.

### Temporal variation

### Optional stopping

Why it's an issue for frequentists

Optamizely using a threshold on FDR from likelihood ratio tests in frequentist setting

Bayesian justifications

p-values versus likelihood ratios

## Estimands

- Average treatment effect
- Treatment on treated

## Effiencicy or Variance Reduction

- look up variance reduction in A/B tests, a common method might be to incorporate precision variables like demographic data or user data such as device or browser. 

e.g. with a two sample t-test, $Y_t - Y_{t-1} = \beta_0$, versus a model $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1}$

- get table for different tests of means from soc sci 10 notes.

## Checking assignment integrety

- Check demographics across buckets, if randomization worked then demographics should be approximately equally represented in the buckets.
