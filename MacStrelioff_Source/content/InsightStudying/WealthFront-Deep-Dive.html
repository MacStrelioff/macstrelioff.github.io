<h1>TODO:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Looking for: “You enjoy mentoring others on subjects such as causal inference, experimental design, data visualization or behavioral psychology”</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Make a few videos on experimentation and causal inference</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work on: “You subscribe to Wealthfront’s values and mission and can articulate the reasons why, and have an understanding of our product, business model and key metrics”</li>
</ul>
<div id="signup-process" class="section level2">
<h2>Signup process:</h2>
<ul>
<li>One page for all “Legal Stuff” questions, instead of a page for each question..</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Is there any dropoff on each question? I’m expecting the dropoff for Legal stuff to be lower if it were one page than compared to it being a page for each question.</li>

<h2>Projects, Tasks, and Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Work closely with a cross-functional growth team of marketers, product managers, and engineers to generate new ideas for growth especially top of funnel, translating open-ended business issues into data questions, identifying practical analytic and A/B testing approaches to validate the ideas, and defining ongoing checks post-implementation to ensure that the growth mechanisms are working as planned. Carry out timely and well-documented analyses that influence our growth and company strategy</li>
<li>Formally mentor junior colleagues and provide technical guidance to the team</li>
<li>Continuously look for, and execute upon, opportunities to improve the quality of our data, infrastructure and products</li>
<li>Understand and communicate a data-driven picture of our clients, product and business (and their interaction) to the company</li>
<li>Promote the automation of repetitive tasks and the creation of tools over ad hoc analyses, making your insights available to anyone that can benefit from them</li>

<h3>Discussion of past work</h3>
<p>PredictIt Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation:</li>
<li>Action:</li>
<li>Result:</li>
<li>Project:</li>
<li>Maybe sketch the fig of price for Trump win versus Republican win</li>
<li>I also aggregated data based on days until expiration, and applied a linear in log odds model at each day.</li>
<li>Found the common S shaped calibration curve that comes up in lab experiments, particularly at 1-2 days before market expiration.</li>
<li>Result:</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: Relates to the economic patterns maybe?</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy Inference Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation:</li>
<li>Project:</li>
<li>Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions.</li>
<li>I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time.</li>
<li>Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time.</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user’s decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings.</li>
<li>More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings.</li>
</ul>
<p>General interest in decision making:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation: Models of multi-alternative decision making are often applied to food preferences to see how people integrate information about price, healthyness, flavor, … .</li>
<li>Excitement: Yelp is basically a giant experiment in multiattribute decision making.</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: Theoretical insights might help in guiding how restaurant informaiton is displayed to consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Insight Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses</li>
<li>Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy</li>
<li>Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant</li>
<li>Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features</li>
</ul>
