<h3>Discussion of past work</h3>
<p>PredictIt Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation:</li>
<li>Action:</li>
<li>Result:</li>
<li>Project:</li>
<li>Maybe sketch the fig of price for Trump win versus Republican win</li>
<li>I also aggregated data based on days until expiration, and applied a linear in log odds model at each day.</li>
<li>Found the common S shaped calibration curve that comes up in lab experiments, particularly at 1-2 days before market expiration.</li>
<li>Result:</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: Relates to the economic patterns maybe?</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy Inference Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation:</li>
<li>Project:</li>
<li>Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions.</li>
<li>I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time.</li>
<li>Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time.</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user’s decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings.</li>
<li>More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings.</li>
</ul>
<p>General interest in decision making:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation: Models of multi-alternative decision making are often applied to food preferences to see how people integrate information about price, healthyness, flavor, … .</li>
<li>Excitement: Yelp is basically a giant experiment in multiattribute decision making.</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: Theoretical insights might help in guiding how restaurant informaiton is displayed to consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Insight Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses</li>
<li>Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy</li>
<li>Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant</li>
<li>Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features</li>
</ul>

<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS -->
<div id="haas-freelance-work" class="section level3">
<h3>HaaS freelance work</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haas stands for housing as a service, it’s a membership-based coliving startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to increase memberships through facebook and google ads.</li>
<li>I am using Google Analytics and Facebook Ad Analytics to devise ads and experiments that will facilitate growth.</li>
<li>Working in Facebook ad analytics and Google analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>To increase CTR, I’m recommending ads with brighter lighting, faces, or colors that contrast FB’s theme of white and blue, as these kinds of thumbnails are associated with higher CTR for YouTube videos.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="insight-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Insight Project</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup focused on digital workspaces (e.g. google docs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted to be able to predict who would convert from a free trial to a paying customer</li>
<li>Wanted to associate product features with conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>I used a random forest model to predict who would convert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, through a consulting project with a startup where I developed a model to predict which trial users would fail to convert to paying customers so that my client could intervene with these users.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="predictit-project" class="section level3">
<h3>PredictIt project</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets aggregate information and incentivize rational behavior, so one would expect the prices to be accurate.</li>
<li>At an individual level, lots of fallacies have been established in lab settings.</li>
<li>I wanted to know if any fallacies would manifest in market prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conjunction fallacy: “Trump” traded higher hand “Republican” for extended period of time.</li>
<li>Disjunction fallacy: Most market prices add up to something greater than $1, but because of fees it’s often not profitable to take advantage of this.</li>
<li>CPT subjective probability function: Overpricing of low probability events and Underpricing of high probability events</li>
<li><p>– notably this was highest as expiration approached, a context that is more similar to lab studies that don’t have delayed rewards.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we’re working on automating trades based on these and other indights.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="quantopian" class="section level3">

<div id="child-bandit-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>Child bandit modeling</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted to know what strategies they followed, and if their strategy changed over time.</li>
<li>Kids we repeatedly choosing between gambles</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>I developed a model that inferred the probability of following each strategy on each trial</li>
<li>Used Bayes’ Rule to smooth out these inferences / accumulate information over trials</li>
</ul>
<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids do seem to switch strategies, probably don’t act optimally, and have different strategies depending on age (switchy vs sticky)</li>
<li>Implications for user intent modeling</li>
