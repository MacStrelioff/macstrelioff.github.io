<h3>Discussion of past work</h3>
<p>PredictIt Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation:</li>
<li>Action:</li>
<li>Result:</li>
<li>Project:</li>
<li>Maybe sketch the fig of price for Trump win versus Republican win</li>
<li>I also aggregated data based on days until expiration, and applied a linear in log odds model at each day.</li>
<li>Found the common S shaped calibration curve that comes up in lab experiments, particularly at 1-2 days before market expiration.</li>
<li>Result:</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: Relates to the economic patterns maybe?</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy Inference Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation:</li>
<li>Project:</li>
<li>Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions.</li>
<li>I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time.</li>
<li>Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time.</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user’s decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings.</li>
<li>More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings.</li>
</ul>
<p>General interest in decision making:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situation: Models of multi-alternative decision making are often applied to food preferences to see how people integrate information about price, healthyness, flavor, … .</li>
<li>Excitement: Yelp is basically a giant experiment in multiattribute decision making.</li>
<li>Value to Yelp: Theoretical insights might help in guiding how restaurant informaiton is displayed to consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Insight Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses</li>
<li>Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy</li>
<li>Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant</li>
<li>Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features</li>
</ul>

<div id="haas-freelance-work" class="section level3">
<h3>HaaS freelance work</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haas stands for housing as a service, it’s a membership-based coliving startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to increase memberships through facebook and google ads.</li>
<li>I’m leveraging a little SEO experience to help with designing ads;</li>
<li>Brighter photos, photos with faces, and color schemes that contrast FB’s color scheme of white and blue,</li>
<li>thse features are associated with higher CTR for YouTube thumbnails.</li>
<li>Becoming familiar with Google Analytics and Facebook Ad Analytics to run A/B tests with these ads</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>See which drive more interest in CTR, and more conversions in applications for membership, and which attract the demographics that my client wants to attract.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="insight-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Insight Project</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 week consulting project</li>
<li>Startup focused on digital workspaces (e.g. google docs)</li>
<li>Wanted to understand user base.</li>
<li>Wanted to be able to predict who would convert from a free trial to a paying customer.</li>
<li>(skip) Wanted to attribute conversion to product features with conversion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data:</li>
<li>Company demographic information, company size and revenue.</li>
<li>Used this to communicate conversion rates by demographic to heads of different teams using tables and figures.</li>
<li>Account activity data which was a sum of actions taken within an account each day.</li>
<li>I transformed this into cumulative sum instead of daily sum to increase interpretability and modeling ease.</li>
</ul>
<p>(skip) Action: (skip) (skip) - Used cross sections of cumulative account activity data after 7 days since the account was created. (skip) - Cast as classification problem, used SMOTE to address class imbalance, (skip) - used 5-fold CV to evaluate models on AUC, (skip) - ended with a RF algorithm for these predictions.</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivered presentation and slide deck with tables and figures to a group of team leaders.</li>
<li>Delivered a Python script to implement the model, and a slide deck describing the modeling procedure and performance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="predictit-project" class="section level3">
<h3>PredictIt project</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets aggregate information and incentivize rational behavior, so one would expect the prices to be accurate.</li>
<li>At an individual level, lots of fallacies have been established in lab settings.</li>
<li>I wanted to know if any fallacies would manifest in market prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conjunction fallacy: “Trump” traded higher hand “Republican” for extended period of time.</li>
<li>Disjunction fallacy: Most market prices add up to something greater than $1, but because of fees it’s often not profitable to take advantage of this.</li>
<li>CPT subjective probability function: Overpricing of low probability events and Underpricing of high probability events</li>
<li><p>– notably this was highest as expiration approached, a context that is more similar to lab studies that don’t have delayed rewards.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we’re working on automating trades based on these and other indights.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="quantopian" class="section level3">
<h3>Quantopian:</h3>

<li>recreated XIV, fund that trades VIX futures weighted so that the effective days to expiration is approximately 30.</li>
<li>mean revision</li>
<li>moving average crossover</li>

<div id="child-bandit-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>Child bandit modeling</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted to know what strategies they followed, and if their strategy changed over time.</li>
<li>Kids we repeatedly choosing between gambles</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>I developed a model that inferred the probability of following each strategy on each trial</li>
<li>Used Bayes’ Rule to smooth out these inferences / accumulate information over trials</li>
</ul>
<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids do seem to switch strategies, probably don’t act optimally, and have different strategies depending on age (switchy vs sticky)</li>
<li>Implications for user intent modeling</li>

<!-- QUESTIONS -->
</div>
</div>
<div id="ideas-excitement-questions-to-ask" class="section level2">
<h2>Ideas, excitement, questions to ask</h2>
<p>notes from call</p>
<ul>
<li>started as wealth management product</li>
<li>financial planning product, now made avilable to everyone, can specify goals for retirement, college saving, home buying, … .</li>
<li>have all data on this, and can project future wealth.</li>
<li>high yield cash account product, beginning of a banking services product</li>
<li>CD, debit, credit card, etc.</li>
<li>self-driving money: idea that they can automate finances for people. to meet short term and long terms savings needs.</li>
<li>system can optimize how money from a paycheck or other accounts should flow between cash, investments, savings, based on these goals.</li>
<li><p>accounts for all tax rules, etc.</p></li>
<li>170 people in company</li>
<li>DS team more diverse (9 people (should be doubling lately))</li>
<li>economists, statisticians, ML, data science, financial, … .</li>
<li>Teams;</li>
<li>investment algorithms</li>
<li>financial planning optimization</li>
<li>analytics (product, market, risk), (~ 4 people)</li>
<li><p>data products, production ready systems</p></li>
<li>Investing in growth: paid marketing, messaging within product to “cross sell”, referrals.</li>
<li>Almost no paid marketing at all, have had some since introducing the cash account.</li>
<li>Still want to apply a science to making it more effective.</li>
<li>looking for ideas on growing cash account via a referral program.</li>
<li><p>hiring one growth DS for across those areas</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li>this initial meeting</li>
<li>technical phone screen: more of a filter, statistics and analytics Hypothesis testing, experimental design (first few items I have listed on methods), nothing like RL and contextual bandits, 1 hour long</li>
<li>homework assignment: programming, 24 hours – can use Python or R, some analytic questions and need to provide some recommendations</li>
<li>longer 5 hour interview</li>
</ul>
<p>Me: - finance as a hobby – Quantopian - HaaS freelance work</p>
<!-- Increase savings! -->
<ul>
<li>Considering Nudges, e.g. maybe showing counterfactuals like how much interest a person would have gotten if they spent X less.</li>
<li>I like the figure showing wealth accumulation – add credible intervals around it if it’s based on uncertain investments?</li>
<li>Add oldified images of a user later on the timeline, maked that future self more concrete and increases saving behavior?</li>
</ul>
<!-- work life -->
<ul>
<li>What do project pipelines look like – who is involved, how are tasks ideated and delegated?</li>
<li>steakholders: marketing team, paid marketing team, ‘growth team’</li>
<li>growth team: a product manager, designer, engineers, and another person, it’s just been formed.</li>
<li>** First work on conversion from cash client to investment client.</li>
<li>** and on paid marketing side, optimizing marketing on facebook, and Google ad words, and working on attribution to allocate marketing budget.</li>
<li>** Lower customer acquisition costs.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Identify cash clients who would have biggest beenfit from opening investment account.</li>
<li>regular check in with head of marketing every couple weeks</li>
<li>Growth DS can look at all of these options (come up with ideas)</li>
<li><p>Don’t want relationship to be where DS just does what marketing team asks. So DS idn’t expected to be marketing expert, but should come up with their own ideas and refine in collaboration with the other teams/partners.</p></li>
<li>More informaiton about the role?</li>
<li>Open projects or current directions?</li>
<li>How big is the DS team?</li>
<li><p>Could you tell me a little about your team specifically?</p></li>
