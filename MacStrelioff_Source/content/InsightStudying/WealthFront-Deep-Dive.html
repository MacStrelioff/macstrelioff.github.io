<li>system can optimize how money from a paycheck or other accounts should flow between cash, investments, savings, based on these goals.</li>
<li>accounts for all tax rules, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Team:</p>
<ul>
<li>170 people in company</li>
<li>DS team more diverse (9 people (should be doubling lately))</li>
<li>economists, statisticians, ML, data science, financial, … .</li>
<li>Teams;</li>
<li>investment algorithms</li>
<li>financial planning optimization</li>
<li>analytics (product, market, risk), (~ 4 people)</li>
<li><p>data products, production ready systems</p></li>
<li>Investing in growth: paid marketing, messaging within product to “cross sell”, referrals.</li>
<li>Almost no paid marketing at all, have had some since introducing the cash account.</li>
<li>Still want to apply a science to making it more effective.</li>
<li>looking for ideas on growing cash account via a referral program.</li>
<li><p>hiring one growth DS for across those areas</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- PROCESS -->
<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li>this initial meeting</li>
<li>technical phone screen: more of a filter, statistics and analytics Hypothesis testing, experimental design (first few items I have listed on methods), nothing like RL and contextual bandits, 1 hour long</li>
<li>homework assignment: programming, 24 hours – can use Python or R, some analytic questions and need to provide some recommendations</li>
<li>longer 5 hour interview</li>
</ul>
<p>Me: - finance as a hobby – Quantopian - HaaS freelance work</p>
<!-- Increase savings! -->
<ul>
<li>Considering Nudges, e.g. maybe showing counterfactuals like how much interest a person would have gotten if they spent X less.</li>
<li>I like the figure showing wealth accumulation – add credible intervals around it if it’s based on uncertain investments?</li>
<li>Add oldified images of a user later on the timeline, maked that future self more concrete and increases saving behavior?</li>
</ul>
<!-- work life -->
<ul>
<li>What do project pipelines look like – who is involved, how are tasks ideated and delegated?</li>
<li>steakholders: marketing team, paid marketing team, ‘growth team’</li>
<li>growth team: a product manager, designer, engineers, and another person, it’s just been formed.</li>
<li>** First work on conversion from cash client to investment client.</li>
<li>** and on paid marketing side, optimizing marketing on facebook, and Google ad words, and working on attribution to allocate marketing budget.</li>
<li>** Lower customer acquisition costs.</li>
<li>Identify cash clients who would have biggest benefit from opening investment account.</li>
<li>regular check in with head of marketing every couple weeks</li>
<li>Growth DS can look at all of these options (come up with ideas)</li>
<li>Don’t want relationship to be where DS just does what marketing team asks. So DS isn’t expected to be marketing expert, but should come up with their own ideas and refine in collaboration with the other teams/partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>questions;</p>
<ul>
<li>More informaiton about the role?</li>
<li>Open projects or current directions?</li>
<li>How big is the DS team?</li>

<li><p>growth will have a DS, someone from marketing, someone from DE, … .</p></li>
<li>What are some upcoming projects?</li>
<li><p>Your research sounds really cool – do you do similar work (i.e. develop samplers) at Wealthfront?</p></li>
<li>Been really picky with decisions</li>

<li>replicated XIV</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>Quantopian had a bug in dividends paid, so I submitted a ticket showing this with AAPL stock, and stopped using that platform..</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Passion for automated financial decision making: PredictIt formula for guarenteed profits that accounted for relationships between prices, probability theory, and PredictIt fees. This is similar to finding an arbitrage relationship (relations between prices and probability theory) and accounting for taxes (fees).</li>
<li>Debated friends about whether buying or renting is better, I liked WealthFront’s analysis on this topic (though it leaves out the tax benefits of buying?)</li>
<li>I also like the principled investment philosophy (Modern protfolio theory, accounting for taxes, … )</li>
</ul>
<!-- Quantopian investment philosophy -->
<ul>
<li>I’m proimarily an income investor</li>
<li>Dividends reflect the risk in a stock, so I wanted to make a portfolio of dividend paying stocks weighted invesely proportional to the dividend yield.</li>
<li>Quantopian dividend data had a bug, so I gave up on this for now..</li>
</ul>
<!-- fit for growth team -->
<ul>
<li>YT channel, casually testing thumbnails</li>
<li>HaaS work on fb ads and google analytics (talk about these tools)</li>

<li>Why would I use Wealthfront?</li>
<li>Why would I switch from savings to their portfolio management?</li>
<li>Why switch from self-management to their portfolio management?</li>

<h2>Project Descriptions:</h2>
<p>Insight Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses</li>
<li>Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy</li>
<li>Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant</li>
<li>Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features</li>
</ul>
<div id="haas-freelance-work" class="section level3">
<h3>HaaS freelance work</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haas stands for housing as a service, it’s a membership-based coliving startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to increase memberships through facebook and google ads.</li>
<li>I’m leveraging a little SEO experience to help with designing ads;</li>
<li>Brighter photos, photos with faces, and color schemes that contrast FB’s color scheme of white and blue,</li>
<li>thse features are associated with higher CTR for YouTube thumbnails.</li>
<li>Becoming familiar with Google Analytics and Facebook Ad Analytics to run A/B tests with these ads</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>See which drive more interest in CTR, and more conversions in applications for membership, and which attract the demographics that my client wants to attract.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="insight-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Insight Project</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 week consulting project</li>
<li>Startup focused on digital workspaces (e.g. google docs)</li>
<li>Wanted to understand user base.</li>
<li>Wanted to be able to predict who would convert from a free trial to a paying customer.</li>
<li>(skip) Wanted to attribute conversion to product features with conversion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data:</li>
<li>Company demographic information, company size and revenue.</li>
<li>Used this to communicate conversion rates by demographic to heads of different teams using tables and figures.</li>
<li>Account activity data which was a sum of actions taken within an account each day.</li>
<li>I transformed this into cumulative sum instead of daily sum to increase interpretability and modeling ease.</li>
</ul>
<p>(skip) Action: (skip) (skip) - Used cross sections of cumulative account activity data after 7 days since the account was created. (skip) - Cast as classification problem, used SMOTE to address class imbalance, (skip) - used 5-fold CV to evaluate models on AUC, (skip) - ended with a RF algorithm for these predictions.</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivered presentation and slide deck with tables and figures to a group of team leaders.</li>
<li>Delivered a Python script to implement the model, and a slide deck describing the modeling procedure and performance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="predictit-project" class="section level3">
<h3>PredictIt project</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets aggregate information and incentivize rational behavior, so one would expect the prices to be accurate.</li>
<li>At an individual level, lots of fallacies have been established in lab settings.</li>
<li>I wanted to know if any fallacies would manifest in market prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conjunction fallacy: “Trump” traded higher hand “Republican” for extended period of time.</li>
<li>Disjunction fallacy: Most market prices add up to something greater than $1, but because of fees it’s often not profitable to take advantage of this.</li>
<li>CPT subjective probability function: Overpricing of low probability events and Underpricing of high probability events</li>
<li><p>– notably this was highest as expiration approached, a context that is more similar to lab studies that don’t have delayed rewards.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we’re working on automating trades based on these and other indights.</p></li>

<div id="child-bandit-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>Child bandit modeling</h3>
<p>Situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted to know what strategies they followed, and if their strategy changed over time.</li>
<li>Kids repeatedly chose between two gambling machines</li>
</ul>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>I developed a model that inferred the probability of following each strategy on each trial</li>
<li>Used Bayes’ Rule to smooth out these inferences / accumulate information over trials</li>
</ul>
<p>Result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids do seem to switch strategies, probably don’t act optimally, and have different strategies depending on age (switchy vs sticky)</li>
<li>Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials – the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time.</li>
