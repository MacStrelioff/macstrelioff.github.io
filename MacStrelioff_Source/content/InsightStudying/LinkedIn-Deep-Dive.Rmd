### Ideas and excitement

Ideas: 

- I've been interested in consulting work. LinkedIn seems to be in an excellent position to become a platform or marketplace for consultants or freelance work.
- 

Excitement:

I like their general work on [inferring user attributes](https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/projects/jobs), [economic research](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/research#all), [experimentation research](http://web.media.mit.edu/~msaveski/assets/publications/2017_detecting_network_effects/paper.pdf) (also [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488509&dl=ACM&coll=DL), [here](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/06/detecting-interference--an-a-b-test-of-a-b-tests)), [latent user research](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2741126), 

### Excitement from Recruiter

- [Student Future](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2015/11/video--higher-ed-team-seeks-to-predict-collegiate-futures), a product to help high school students choose universities, based on entering a company and a role and seeing statistics about the schools that people with those jobs attended. 
- [InDay](https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/07/29/inday-investing-in-our-employees-so-they-can-invest-in-themselves) -- LinkedIn officially takes one day a month to allow employees to give back to the community, company, or themselves in some (themed) way.
- [Economics graph](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/resources/linkedin-workforce-report-may-2018) project that gives reports on skills gaps and migrations. 
- I noticed the job ad emails that I get seem based on my job search, possibly more-so than my skills.. Do you think you'd get more retention / engagement by recommending jobs based on skills or degrees and work history, rather than past searches? Or at least exploring this -- randomizing emails to suggest jobs based on search vs based on skills and experience.
