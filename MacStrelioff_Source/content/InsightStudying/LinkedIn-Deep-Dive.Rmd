# Company Visit

## Chris info -- 


- DS people generally get interviewed on computer engineering topics -- eg implementing data structures from scratch, ... 
- Interview centrally for AI organization, then get matched with a team. 
- Module on CS which is like data structures, 
- LeetCode medium, but also more of a conversation
- Binary converter from scratch
- Being able to describe process
- ML on fundamentals of ML, basics and some applications
- Optional product design module
- lots of coding things on a whiteboard
- coding style matters / code should be interpratable
- making sure code would work, eg walk through an example or test cases, think of edge cases

# Recruiter Call

Graydon, sr recruiter at linkedin

- Ping if I hear nothing by Friday. 

- Why linkedin -- role sounded awesome when presented at Insight. After looking into LinkedIn more, I came across papers on inferring latent user types, and that kind of work is really interesting to me. Generally though, I'm interested in experimentation roles and sequential testing, efficient experimentation and optional stopping. 



# Recruiter email II -- Interviews

Here is the outline of what to expect from your onsite in terms of the structure:

## Host Leader (45 mins):

One of the interviews will be done by a host manager; this person may, or may not, end up being the final hiring manager, but will be able to provide you with information on the different projects, engineering team culture, challenges, etc. He/she will be asking you about: 

- your career history
- your job search (why you’re looking, why is LinkedIn interesting, what technologies are you interested in)
- and an overview of interesting projects you worked on, and your involvement in these projects.

- History: PredictIt project, strategy inference, decision making
- Job Search: Generally like experimentation roles. I was first interested in LinkedIn because the anti-abuse team sounded awesome. I also liked the demo experience, there was a big turn out, and people seemed engaged. But overall the most exciting thing to me has been how company culture manifests in things like InDay, where individual across the company take time to give back to the community. I also really like the value that LinkedIn adds, and the direction LinkedIn seems to be going in, in terms of identifying the skills a person can learn to advance their career and advertising helpful resources to them. Thinking about my own journey through academia and now into data science, I spent a lot of time browsing Coursera, YouTube, and various online resources -- I can imagine LinkedIn learning becoming a streamlined product for independent lerarning that basically syncs with your professional LinkedIn profile. 
- I like the idea to [engage high school students](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2015/11/video--higher-ed-team-seeks-to-predict-collegiate-futures), and opening access to knowledge of hiring practices, career trajectories, and salary ranges. I come from a family of construction workers, so I was very much a black swan while figuring out how to navigate through community college, undergraduate school, and graduate school, and now into a technical career. I grew up in 'blue collar' world, and broke into the academic world, and now I'm jumping into 'white collar' technical industry world. This was really hard, and required a lot of self-learning and building professional relationships -- so I very much understand the value that LinkedIn can add for people like me. 
- So yeah I can see LinkedIn as something that moderates the education market, and the labor market -- and based on my experiences navigating these things mostly on my own, I'd be really interested in contributing to products that democratize education and professional connections. 
- Also really interested in the almost academic work that has come out of LinkedIn -- I found papers on inferring user attributes, which is a very similar problem to one of my favorite projects in grad school. For that project I (kid gambling, strategy inference project). 
- Also interested in the economics work (see others in 'excitement' section below)
- Overall, exciting work and a culture / mission / potential that resonates with me. 
- Online Bayesian Logistic Regression: 

## Data Manipulation (45mins):

- Goal: assess ability to manipulate and analyze data for extracting insights
- Usually at least 1 SQL question + 1 R or Python question
- Familiarity with SQL AND R or Python is required for Senior Data Scientist.
- Determine familiarity of advanced analytical functions


## Analytics Case Study (45mins):

- To assess ability to solve a business case with the right analytical approach and reasonable data intuition; and the ability to make relevant product recommendation based on data insights.
_ Asses your familiarity with the LinkedIn Platform
- Ability to correctly communicate and present solutions

LinkedIn Metrics: 

- VPI (views per impression) for a job recommendation
- API (applications per impression) for a job application
- Job fits: Person-Environment (P-E) -- comprised of Person-Organization (P-O), Person-Vocation (P-V), Person-Group (P-G), and Person-Job (P-J) fits

## Statistical Modeling (45mins):

- Evaluate and asses analytical thinking and familiarity with the LinkedIn Platform.
- Assess your ability to take business context and translate to an analytical problem
- Evaluate experience working with statistical modeling techniques
- Testing/Training/Evaluating models
- Asses knowledge of model methodologies
 
 
 TODO: 
 
 - LOOK UP OVERFITTING, and how to detect it
 - Look up confusion martix

## Statistics & A/B Testing (45mins):

- Design and analyze experimentations, understands basic stats concepts (e.g. hypothesis testing, mean, variance, probability distributions, sample size calculation, power calculation...) and how to apply them in a business setting.
- For Sr DS, must show an in-depth understanding of A/B testing is needed (e.g. multi-variant testing, sample size calculation, power…)
- Asses knowledge of probability

## Deep Dive

### Users

### Current issues

GROWTH: LinkedIn is now backed by microsoft, wants to develop new products, and acquire more users -- particularly those in underserved segments like blue collar labor. 

### Competitors


### Ideas and excitement

Ideas: 

- For blue collar workers, again become a marketplace, somewhere where contractors (blue collar) can meet with clients, similar to Yelp's segment for contractors. 
- Insight, lots of other interview prep that LinkedIn might be able to assist with.. Eg resume review verticals, behavioral interview questions, mock interviewing services, Coding practice like LeetCode (see that this is being worked in with skill quizes).
- The AirBnb or Uber of consulting / freelance work. I've been interested in consulting work. LinkedIn seems to be in an excellent position to become a platform or marketplace for consultants or freelance work.
- lower level education, which LinkedIn is already working on with their student future products (students can see what colleges are associated with careers and companies they like).

Excitement:

I like their general work on [inferring user attributes](https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/projects/jobs), [economic research](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/research#all), [experimentation research](http://web.media.mit.edu/~msaveski/assets/publications/2017_detecting_network_effects/paper.pdf) (also [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488509&dl=ACM&coll=DL), [here](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/06/detecting-interference--an-a-b-test-of-a-b-tests)), [latent user research](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2741126), 

### Excitement from Recruiter

- [Student Future](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2015/11/video--higher-ed-team-seeks-to-predict-collegiate-futures), a product to help high school students choose universities, based on entering a company and a role and seeing statistics about the schools that people with those jobs attended. 
- [InDay](https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/07/29/inday-investing-in-our-employees-so-they-can-invest-in-themselves) -- LinkedIn officially takes one day a month to allow employees to give back to the community, company, or themselves in some (themed) way.
- [Economics graph](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/resources/linkedin-workforce-report-may-2018) project that gives reports on skills gaps and migrations. 
- I noticed the job ad emails that I get seem based on my job search, possibly more-so than my skills.. Do you think you'd get more retention / engagement by recommending jobs based on skills or degrees and work history, rather than past searches? Or at least exploring this -- randomizing emails to suggest jobs based on search vs based on skills and experience.
