# TODO: 

- Looking for: "You enjoy mentoring others on subjects such as causal inference, experimental design, data visualization or behavioral psychology"
- - Make a few videos on experimentation and causal inference

## Signup process:

- One page for all "Legal Stuff" questions, instead of a page for each question.. 
- - Is there any dropoff on each question? I'm expecting the dropoff for Legal stuff to be lower if it were one page than compared to it being a page for each question.

## Culture and Vision

- "We’re here because more people across the economic spectrum deserve to live secure and rewarding lives."
- 

## Business Model

- Offer a high yield savings account 
- Offer funds managed by the author of 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street'
- Use Modern Portfolio Theory, smart beta and tax-loss harvesting for larger accounts. 
- Collect a 0.25% fee on managed funds

## Projects, Tasks, and Data

- Work closely with a cross-functional growth team of marketers, product managers, and engineers to generate new ideas for growth especially top of funnel, translating open-ended business issues into data questions, identifying practical analytic and A/B testing approaches to validate the ideas, and defining ongoing checks post-implementation to ensure that the growth mechanisms are working as planned. Carry out timely and well-documented analyses that influence our growth and company strategy
- Formally mentor junior colleagues and provide technical guidance to the team
- Continuously look for, and execute upon, opportunities to improve the quality of our data, infrastructure and products
- Understand and communicate a data-driven picture of our clients, product and business (and their interaction) to the company
- Promote the automation of repetitive tasks and the creation of tools over ad hoc analyses, making your insights available to anyone that can benefit from them

## DS Role

- 4+ years of experience operating successfully within a world-class data science team or academic program
- Ability to access, transform, visualize, and model datasets with minimal engineering support, and communicate your results clearly, both verbally and in writing
- A firm foundation, rooted in experience, of the basic tool-box of regression and classification models, as well as causal inference, experimental design and time series modeling
- You can effectively prioritize and objectively edit your own work
- You care about producing reproducible work and have picked up tools to this end
- You enjoy mentoring others on subjects such as causal inference, experimental design, data visualization or behavioral psychology
- You have built something first hand that you’re proud of
- You are currently learning something outside of your immediate line of work
- Programming competency in R, Python, and SQL is a plus
- BS, MS, or PhD in computer science, mathematics, economics or related field


### Discussion of past work


PredictIt Project:

- Situation: 
- Action: 
- Result: 
- Project: 
- Maybe sketch the fig of price for Trump win versus Republican win
- I also aggregated data based on days until expiration, and applied a linear in log odds model at each day. 
- Found the common S shaped calibration curve that comes up in lab experiments, particularly at 1-2 days before market expiration.
- Result: 
- Value to Yelp: Relates to the economic patterns maybe? 

Strategy Inference Project:

- Situation: 
- Project: 
- Children and adults might use different strategies when making decisions. 
- I worked with a friend to formalize the possible set of strategies, and then I implemented a model to infer the probability of a kid following each strategy on each trial, and applied Bayes Theorem to get a probability that the kid was following any strategy over time. 
- Result: A lot of experiments focus on which strategy best fits all data across trials -- the approach that I took allows for changes in strategies, and the exciting result was an ability to track latent decision making strategies over time. 
- Value to Yelp: At yelp, for example, a user might be choosing restaurants based primarily on value, then shift to preferring restaurants based on rating. An analogous modeling approach might be able to detect, in near real time, the features that are driving an individual user's decisions. This informaiton could then be used to modify search rankings. 
- More specifically, model click probability as a function of value and stars, estimate the coefficients online, and use the coefficients to prioritize these features in rankings. 

General interest in decision making: 

- Situation: Models of multi-alternative decision making are often applied to food preferences to see how people integrate information about price, healthyness, flavor, ... . 
- Excitement: Yelp is basically a giant experiment in multiattribute decision making. 
- Value to Yelp: Theoretical insights might help in guiding how restaurant informaiton is displayed to consumers. 

Insight Project: 

- User funnel and user flow, maybe should have started at these simpler analyses
- Learned lots about decision trees, random forests versus gradient boosting and gini impurity versus mean decreas in accuracy
- Chose gini impurity because mean decrease in accuracy labels collinear features as unimportant
- Chose random forests because it does a better job of pulling out important collinear features

### Product metrics or experimentation
"You have a good chance of getting a product metrics or experimentation question based on some actual questions Yelp is tackling at the moment."

## Stakeholders and Use Cases

- Consumers: 
- Delivery:
- Stores: 

## User Flows and Metrics

Thinking of the broader user flow can help with identifying measurable events within that flow (metrics).
Overall, consider units of individuals (accounts, unique visitors, cookies, IPs...), units of time (daily, weekly), and referents (week over week, ...)

- good source for some key [metrics](https://www.yelp.com/knowledge)

### On Web

1. Users (IPs) arrive on Yelp, can be assigned a cookie, or associated with an account if the user creates one. 

- Growth: DAU, MAU
- Growth: monthly new users, monthly unique users
- Engagement: Reviews per user per month
- Engagement: 
- Engagement: Traffic to business pages
- Monetization: Reservations
- Monetization: Waitlist

- Performance: Wait times at restaurants

<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS -->


### HaaS freelance work

Situation: 

- Haas stands for housing as a service, it's a membership-based coliving startup.

Task: 

- Want to increase memberships through facebook and google ads. 
- I am using Google Analytics and Facebook Ad Analytics to devise ads and experiments that will facilitate growth.
- Working in Facebook ad analytics and Google analytics

Action: 

- To increase CTR, I'm recommending ads with brighter lighting, faces, or colors that contrast FB's theme of white and blue, as these kinds of thumbnails are associated with higher CTR for YouTube videos. 

### Insight Project

Situation: 

- Startup focused on digital workspaces (e.g. google docs)

Task: 

- Wanted to be able to predict who would convert from a free trial to a paying customer
- Wanted to associate product features with conversion

Action: 

- I used a random forest model to predict who would convert. 

Result: 

- First, through a consulting project with a startup where I developed a model to predict which trial users would fail to convert to paying customers so that my client could intervene with these users. 

### PredictIt project

Situation: 

- Prediction markets aggregate information and incentivize rational behavior, so one would expect the prices to be accurate. 
- At an individual level, lots of fallacies have been established in lab settings.
- I wanted to know if any fallacies would manifest in market prices. 

Results: 

- Conjunction fallacy: "Trump" traded higher hand "Republican" for extended period of time.
- Disjunction fallacy: Most market prices add up to something greater than $1, but because of fees it's often not profitable to take advantage of this. 
- CPT subjective probability function: Overpricing of low probability events and Underpricing of high probability events
- -- notably this was highest as expiration approached, a context that is more similar to lab studies that don't have delayed rewards. 

### Quantopian: 

- recreated XIV, fund that trades VIX futures weighted so that the effective days to expiration is approximately 30.
- mean revision
- moving average crossover

### Child bandit modeling

Situation: 

- Kids we repeatedly choosing between gambles
- Wanted to know what strategies they followed, and if their strategy changed over time

Action: 

- I developed a model that inferred the probability of following each strategy on each trial
- Used Bayes' Rule to smooth out these inferences / accumulate information over trials 

Result: 

- Kids do seem to switch strategies, probably don't act optimally, and have different strategies depending on age (switchy vs sticky)
