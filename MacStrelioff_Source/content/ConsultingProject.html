<h1>Insight</h1>
<p>Insight is a data science fellowship where Fellows work on a 2 week project. For my project, I consulted with Elastic Projects to understand user conversion on their product, <a href="https://www.abstract.com/">Abstract</a>. Abstract is a file sharing and versioning application, much like GitHub, with an emphasis on digital artwork.</p>
<!--- borrow information from Abstract's website --->

<h1>Business Value and Project Goals</h1>
<p>The survival of any company hinges on it’s ability to acquire new users. One way that Elastic Projects acquires users is through a 30-day free trial of their product, <a href="https://www.abstract.com/">Abstract</a>. However, around 80% of free-trial users fail to convert to paying customers. This leaves much opportunity to increase their userbase.</p>
<div id="project-goals" class="section level2">
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>As a consultant for Elastic Projects, I helped with two major goals;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>User segmentation: Understand who was enrolling for free tirals of Abstract, and who continued as a paying customer.</li>
<li>User acquisition: Identify who to nudge, and how to nude them.</li>
</ol>
<!--- 
My work presented here helped Elastic Projects to identify ways to increase the proportion of users that subscribe for paid service by uncovering usage behavior most indicative of a propensity to convert.

<h1>Data sources</h1>
<!---(exclude clearbit)--->
<p>There were two primary sources of data – user activity data, and product performance data.</p>
<p>Question: Do product issues stop users from engaging with the app?</p>

<h1>Thinking</h1>
<p>Payers and non-payers Might differ in distributions of activity</p>
<p>Those who end up paying might differ in the distribution of these engagement metrics.</p>
<p>This lead to exploration that focused on these distributions</p>
<p>This lead to LDA and QDA as the first algorithms that I considered.</p>
