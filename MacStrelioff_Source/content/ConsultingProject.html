<p>Insight …</p>
<p>For my project, I consulted with Elastic Projects to understand user conversion on their product, Abstract.</p>

<h1>Business Value</h1>
<p>The survival of any company hinges on it’s ability to acquire new users. One way to attract users, is to offer a free trials of a product. Elastic Projects offers a free trial of their product, <a href="https://www.abstract.com/">Abstract</a> to new users for 30 days.</p>
<p>My work helped Elastic Projects to understand their user demographic and identify ways to nudge trial users that could increase the proportion of users that subscribe.</p>

<p>Payers and non-payers Might differ in distributions of activity</p>
<p>Those who end up paying might differ in the distribution of these engagement metrics.</p>
<p>This lead to exploration that focused on these distributions</p>
<p>This lead to LDA and QDA as the first algorithms that I considered.</p>
