# Insight

Insight is a data science fellowship where Fellows work on a 2 week project. For my project, I consulted with Elastic Projects to understand user conversion on their product, [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/). Abstract is a file sharing and versioning application, much like GitHub, with an emphasis on digital artwork.

# Business Value and Project Goals

The survival of any company hinges on it's ability to acquire new users. One way that Elastic Projects acquires users is through a 30-day free trial of their product, [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/). However, around 80\% of free-trial users fail to convert to paying customers. This leaves much opportunity to increase their userbase.

## Project Goals

As a consultant for Elastic Projects, I helped with two major goals;

1. User segmentation: Understand who was enrolling for free tirals of Abstract, and who continued as a paying customer.
2. User acquisition: Identify who to nudge, and how to nude them.

<!--- 
My work presented here helped Elastic Projects to identify ways to increase the proportion of users that subscribe for paid service by uncovering usage behavior most indicative of a propensity to convert.

# Data sources
<!---(exclude clearbit)--->

There were two primary sources of data -- user activity data, and product performance data. 

Question: Do product issues stop users from engaging with the app?

## Data preparation

feature engineering

account age

cumulative sums

# Thinking

Payers and non-payers Might differ in distributions of activity

Those who end up paying might differ in the distribution of these engagement metrics.

This lead to exploration that focused on these distributions

This lead to LDA and QDA as the first algorithms that I considered.

# Exploration

Modeling 

discriminant analyses, ... 

# Modeling

regression trees, boosted trees, support vector classifier
