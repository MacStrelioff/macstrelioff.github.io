# Insight 

Insight ... 

For my project, I consulted with Elastic Projects to understand user conversion on their product, Abstract. 

# Business Value

The survival of any company hinges on it's ability to acquire new users. One way to attract users, is to offer a free trials of a product. Elastic Projects offers a free trial of their product, [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/) to new users for 30 days. 

My work helped Elastic Projects to understand their user demographic and identify ways to nudge trial users that could increase the proportion of users that subscribe. 

## Specific Goals

Identify who to nudge and how to nudge them. 

# Data sources 
<!---(exclude clearbit)--->

There were two primary sources of data -- user activity data, and product performance data. 

Question: Do product issues stop users from engaging with the app?

## Data preparation

feature engineering

account age

cumulative sums

# Thinking

Payers and non-payers Might differ in distributions of activity

Those who end up paying might differ in the distribution of these engagement metrics.

This lead to exploration that focused on these distributions

This lead to LDA and QDA as the first algorithms that I considered.

# Exploration

Modeling 

discriminant analyses, ... 

# Modeling

regression trees, boosted trees, support vector classifier
