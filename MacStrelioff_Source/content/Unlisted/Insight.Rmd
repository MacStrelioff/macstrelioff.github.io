### Car price recommender

(this has already been done on fb...)

Sync data from Facebook, Amazon, and Kelly Blue Book to find distributions over car prices, to empower buyers and sellers in social markets. 

I wanted to sell a car and didn't know what it was worth. 

Learn the KBB API, setup a shiny app that allows one to enter KBB info, and query KBB and FB and Amazon for KBB price, and amazon and fb postings.
