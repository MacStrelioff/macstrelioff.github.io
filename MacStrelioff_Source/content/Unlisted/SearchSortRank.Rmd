## Recommendation

Lots of [recommendation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system)

Data science methods play a major role in discovering recommendations for users. 

Econ, compliments and substitutes (competitors). 

Types of recommendation; compliments (these go together), competitors (you might also like...), temporal (might buy this again in the future). Horizontal and vertical focus 

Temporal involves forecasting, which is a topic for another post.
