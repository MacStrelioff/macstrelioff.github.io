<h1>Professional Skills</h1>
<div id="mindset-day-1-632019" class="section level2">
<h2>Mindset (Day 1: 6/3/2019)</h2>
<p>Imposter syndrome</p>
<p>Fail quickly and iterate</p>
<p>Open mindedness – new problem space, …</p>
<p>Adaptability, identify weakenesses and adapt</p>
</div>
<div id="opportunities-networking-and-company-visits" class="section level2">
<h2>Opportunities: Networking and Company Visits</h2>
<p>At Insight, data science hiring teams frequently visit. During the first week, we had visits from Square, Lab 41, and App Annie.</p>
<p>Attempt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask questions to assess fit: size, hierarchy, business model / monetization</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Questions” purely intended to demonstrate your own knowledge. Instead, introduce yourself after the talk.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="applying" class="section level2">
<h2>Applying</h2>
<p>Identify strengths, and demonstrantions of value to a company</p>

<div id="resume" class="section level3">
<h3>Resume</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEhTuQ4kvUU&amp;feature=youtu.be">workshop lecture</a></p>
<p>Resume is a marketing tool to get an interview. Resumes should be understood in 15-45 seconds.</p>
<p>Audience:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hiring managers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Wants: quickly hire, culture fit, compliments skillsets on team</li>
<li>Dislike: lack of detail, ‘fluff’, verbose</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recruiter</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Wants: Pass high quality</li>
<li>Dislikes: Poor writing or grammer, “creative” resumes that take time to orient to, verbose</li>
</ul>
<p>Convey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical fit for role</li>
<li>Potential for learning and growth</li>
<li>Unique professional value (differentiation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Components:</p>
<p>Order from most to least impactful. Focus on content relevant for next role.</p>
<ul>
<li>Header, contact information. Location that is local to the company being applied to. LinkedIn should also include anything not on resume.</li>
<li>Skills, core competencies for recruiter to check off required skills. Sort into meaningful clusters.</li>
<li>Experience, for hiring manager. Include evidence of the skills. Talk about publications here, and emphasize their impact or value. Start with past-tense verb. Situation, Task, Action, Result.</li>
<li>Education, also mainly for recruiters. Could include a section on specific courses, but would be more impactful as projects in the experience section.</li>
<li>NO SUMMARY, experience is more valuable. Can put one on LinkedIn. Avoid making too specific (pidgenhole) or general (cliche).</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include numbers to quantify impacts, numbers can be salient relative to text.</li>
<li>Include URLs, for those who read on paper.</li>
<li>Consistent puncuation, … .</li>
</ul>

<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Email;</p>
<p>The start of Insight is next week and we’re looking forward to meeting all of you in person! You’re likely aware by now that you’ll be spending a large portion of your time at Insight working on a data science project. These projects are designed to provide evidence of the value you would bring to a data science team and your ability to learn and iterate at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>It’s not necessary for you to come to Insight with a project idea in mind (but it can’t hurt!), and we’ll spend the first few days generating and refining project ideas. However, we know that inspiration often strikes when you’re not seeking it, and previous Fellows have mentioned they wish they had come with some ideas in mind.</p>
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<p>Don’t dismiss any ideas while brainstorming. You might find after talking through the idea with someone else that it’s more viable than you thought. We’re emphasizing quantity over quality at this point - add it to the list!</p>
<p>Start with the question/product and think personal. What issues in your life can be solved using data? Think about your hobbies, your daily routine, your job, the tech you regularly interact with. How could it be improved or personalized?</p>
<p>Think about the user and use case. Who would benefit from this product? Why would they use it?</p>
<p>Start thinking about data sources. There are many publicly available datasets, and Fellows in the past have gotten creative with techniques like web scraping and calls to website APIs to get the data they want. That being said, don’t find a dataset first and then try to turn it into a product.</p>
<p>Don’t become overly attached to just one project idea. We’ll work together during the first week to refine your project, and we know very well which types of projects work well and which don’t!</p>
<p>To reiterate - First think about the problem and your target audience rather than spending all of your time searching for datasets. And don’t fret if you haven’t been struck by inspiration before Day 1! We encourage you to discuss project ideas in the ~projects-DS channel on our 19BSV Mattermost Team!</p>
