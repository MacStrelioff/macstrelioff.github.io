<p>Adaptability, identify weakenesses and adapt</p>

<h3>Resume</h3>

<p>Resume is a marketing tool to get an interview. Resumes should be understood in 15-45 seconds.</p>
<p>Audience:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hiring managers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Wants: quickly hire, culture fit, compliments skillsets on team</li>
<li>Dislike: lack of detail, ‘fluff’, verbose</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recruiter</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Wants: Pass high quality</li>
<li>Dislikes: Poor writing or grammer, “creative” resumes that take time to orient to, verbose</li>
</ul>
<p>Convey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical fit for role</li>
<li>Potential for learning and growth</li>
<li>Unique professional value (differentiation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Components:</p>
<p>Order from most to least impactful. Focus on content relevant for next role.</p>
<ul>
<li>Header, contact information. Location that is local to the company being applied to. LinkedIn should also include anything not on resume.</li>
<li>Skills, core competencies for recruiter to check off required skills. Sort into meaningful clusters.</li>
<li>Experience, for hiring manager. Include evidence of the skills. Talk about publications here, and emphasize their impact or value. Start with past-tense verb. Situation, Task, Action, Result.</li>
<li>Education, also mainly for recruiters. Could include a section on specific courses, but would be more impactful as projects in the experience section.</li>
<li>NO SUMMARY, experience is more valuable. Can put one on LinkedIn. Avoid making too specific (pidgenhole) or general (cliche).</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include numbers to quantify impacts, numbers can be salient relative to text.</li>
<li>Include URLs, for those who read on paper.</li>
<li>Consistent puncuation, … .</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="pitch" class="section level3">
<h3>Pitch</h3>
<p>A pitch is a quick and compelling story used to start conversations.</p>
<p>10 second:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Hi I’m (). I got my PhD in () where I used () to ()”</li>
<li>“Hi I’m Mac. I got my PhD in Cognitive Science at UC Irvine, where I used reinforcement learning algorithms as models of how people learn about and interact with a new technology.”</li>
</ul>
<p>30 second:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appeals to imagination and empathy to facilitate recall and decision-making</li>
<li>Differentaites you as a leader rather than hopeful employee</li>
<li>Creates a story from past experiences that clearly leads to the target job</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="demos" class="section level3">
<h3>Demos</h3>
<p>A demo is a presentation of work to a hiring committee.</p>
<p>Kinds of questions to anticipate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very techinical questions</li>
<li>Business sense</li>
<li>Thought process – diagnostics, model selection, validation or definition of success</li>
<li>Alternative approaches, and their strengths and weaknesses</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="opportunities-networking-and-company-visits" class="section level2">
<h2>Opportunities: Networking and Company Visits</h2>
<p>At Insight, data science hiring teams frequently visit. During the first week, we had visits from Square, Lab 41, and App Annie.</p>
<p>Attempt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask questions to assess fit: size, hierarchy, business model / monetization</li>
<li>Ask about experiences – “Tell me about a time when someone …”. This leads to an opportunity to make them feel heard and important, or to foster a sense of connection around a similar shared experience.</li>
<li>Demonstrating curiosity and engagement, to foster a connection and sense of trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Questions” purely intended to demonstrate your own knowledge. Instead, introduce yourself after the talk.</li>
<li>Trying to prove you are smarter than the conterparty, which can make them view you as a threat. Instead cooperate with them to foster trust.</li>
<li>Implying that their company is inferior to a competitor, this can make them feel defensive and mitigate the potential for a trusting connection.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>populate from consulting class…</li>
</ul>
<p>Constant communication to clarify goals and stay on track. It can be tempting or habitual to conduct an extravagent analysis without regard for its usefulness to the cliant – avoid this waste of time by continually checking in, presenting work, and clarifying the client’s goals and desired outcomes.</p>

<h3>Business Value Statement</h3>

<li>Summarize project and its use case</li>
</ol>
<p>“I’m using [data] to develop [deliverable] that [outcome] so that [client] can [solution to problem]”</p>
<p>Mine was: “I’m using daily user activity during a free trial to estimate the probability that the user will convert to a paid user, so that my client can decide when and how to nudge free users that are unlikely to convert”</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Quantify impact;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Statistics that give the scope of the problem</li>
<li>What is the market, or how many potential customers exist?</li>
<li>What resources, and how much, will the solution save?</li>
</ul>
<p>“The fate of a start-up hinges on user acquisition.”</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Broaden use case. Convey the abstract or general challenge that was solved.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine for final pitch</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My value statement for this project was:</p>
<p>“The fate of a start-up depends on user acquisition. I’m using data on user behavior during a free trial to estimate the probability that a free user will convert to a paid user, and determine which product features drive this conversion. My analysis will guide decisions about when and how to nudge the free users that are unlikely to convert, so that my client can acquire more paying users”</p>
<p>Things to consider;</p>
<ul>
<li>Concise description of project</li>
<li>Who are the potential users, how many exist?</li>
<li>What problem is solved, evidence that it is a real problem</li>
<li>What solutions already exist, how is yours better? How would this solution save time, money, emotional headache, … ?</li>
<li>After watching the demo, what skills would the audiance know you can offer on Day 1? How will your demo make these skills explicit?</li>
<li>Given the technical challenges of executing the project, who is going to be most excited to interview you? How does your project relate to the challenges they face? (specific companies, types of teams, industries, … )</li>
</ul>
<p>Product: I’m conducting analyses on user demographics, and making a model to predict user conversion after a free trial.</p>
<p>Potential users: My client. Various teams will use the demographic analyses.</p>
<p>Problem: Want to know what features or experiences with the product are driving sales.</p>
<p>competitors: none here.</p>
<p>After demo: Summary stat skills for demographics, root cause analysis for finding features that drive conversion, feature engineering for the predictive model, ML model building and fitting. Interpreting data for a general audience.</p>
<p>Who will like the presentation?: Collaborative teams, since I delivered a little for mutltiple teams. Teams that rely on data scientists for business decisions, since I worked actionably product insights.</p>
