# Overview

Use the menu on the left to change topics, and the menu on the right to find videos within topics. A complete list of my videos can be found on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8KypaF6w6K0SO6KLvyst8w?view_as=subscriber). 

I started making videos while I was a Teaching Assistant at UC Irvine for students who couldn't make my discussion sections. Later I noticed a dearth of materials focused specifically on interview preparation for data scientists. I started making videos again to address this shortfall.

- Aman's question - sample from a circle using a random number generator
- solution 1, ineffective is rejection sampling, sample from a square, then only accept samples within the circle
- circle question from Google
- estimate median from Google
- variances of different experiment designs
- multinomial and guessers 'favorite color' and a proportion of users who guess randomly
- bandits vs A/B tests, particularly for lots of conditions
- LI: android you can randomize, iphone you can't (synthetic control)
- strengths & weaknesses of different ML algorithms (complex to simple explanations)
