# Overview

Use the menu on the left to change topics, and the menu on the right to find videos within topics. A complete list of my videos can be found on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8KypaF6w6K0SO6KLvyst8w?view_as=subscriber). 

I started making videos while I was a Teaching Assistant at UC Irvine for students who couldn't make my discussion sections. Later I noticed a dearth of materials focused specifically on interview preparation for data scientists. I started making videos again to address this shortfall.
